#### **1. Monetizing with Ad Placements**

Displaying ads on her blog is one of the most common and straightforward ways Alice can earn money from her site. There are several ways to do this effectively:

##### **a. Google AdSense**

**Google AdSense** is a popular platform for displaying contextual ads on WordPress sites. Alice can earn money whenever visitors view or click on the ads.

- **How to Get Started:**
  - Visit the [Google AdSense](https://www.google.com/adsense/start/) website and create an account.
  - Once approved, Alice can add the AdSense code to her WordPress site using widgets or plugins like **Ad Inserter**.
- **Best Practices for Ad Placement:**
  - **Above the Fold:** Place ads where they are visible without scrolling, such as near the top of the page.
  - **In-Content Ads:** Embedding ads within content can improve engagement without being too disruptive.
  - **Sidebar and Footer:** Alice can use widget areas for less intrusive ad placements.
- **Pros and Cons:**
  - *Pros*: Easy to implement, passive income potential, customizable ad placements.
  - *Cons*: Earnings depend heavily on traffic volume, and excessive ads may detract from the user experience.

##### **b. Direct Ad Sales**

Alice can sell ad space directly to brands in her niche. This approach often leads to higher earnings per ad placement compared to networks like AdSense.

- **Benefits of Direct Ad Sales:**
  - No middleman, so Alice retains a higher percentage of ad revenue.
  - More control over ad content and appearance.
- **How to Get Started:**
  - Create an *Advertise with Us* page outlining traffic statistics, audience demographics, and available ad slots.
  - Use a plugin like **AdRotate** to manage and track ad performance.

##### **c. Native Advertising and Sponsored Content**

Native ads blend seamlessly with Alice’s content, providing a more user-friendly experience than traditional banner ads.

- **Sponsored Posts:** Brands may pay Alice to write posts featuring their products or services.
- **Disclosure Requirements:** Alice should always disclose sponsored content to comply with advertising guidelines and maintain transparency with her readers.
