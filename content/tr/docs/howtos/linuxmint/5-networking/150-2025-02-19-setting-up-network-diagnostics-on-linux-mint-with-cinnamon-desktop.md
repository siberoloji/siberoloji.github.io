Network diagnostics are essential for maintaining a healthy and efficient network system on Linux Mint. This comprehensive guide will walk you through setting up and using various diagnostic tools to monitor, troubleshoot, and optimize your network performance.

## Essential Diagnostic Tools Installation

First, let's install the necessary diagnostic tools. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nmap mtr-tiny traceroute netcat-openbsd smokeping bmon ethtool net-tools dstat iperf3 speedtest-cli
```

This installs:

- nmap: Network exploration and security scanning
- mtr: Network diagnostic tool combining ping and traceroute
- traceroute: Network route tracing utility
- netcat: Network connection utility
- smokeping: Latency measurement tool
- bmon: Bandwidth monitoring
- ethtool: Ethernet card settings
- net-tools: Network configuration utilities
- dstat: System resource statistics
- iperf3: Network performance testing
- speedtest-cli: Internet speed testing

## Setting Up Basic Network Diagnostics

### System Monitoring Configuration

1. Configure Network Manager Logging:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/debug-logging.conf
```

Add the following content:

```ini
[logging]
level=DEBUG
domains=ALL
```

2. Restart Network Manager:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
```

### Creating a Network Diagnostic Directory

Set up a dedicated directory for logs and scripts:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/network-diagnostics/{logs,scripts,reports}
chmod 755 ~/network-diagnostics
```

## Implementing Automated Diagnostic Tools

### Creating a Basic Network Health Check Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Save as ~/network-diagnostics/scripts/network-health.sh

LOGFILE=~/network-diagnostics/logs/network-health-$(date +%Y%m%d).log

echo "Network Health Check - $(date)" > $LOGFILE
echo "------------------------" >> $LOGFILE

# Check DNS resolution
echo "DNS Resolution Test:" >> $LOGFILE
dig google.com +short >> $LOGFILE 2>&1
echo "" >> $LOGFILE

# Check default gateway
echo "Default Gateway:" >> $LOGFILE
ip route | grep default >> $LOGFILE
echo "" >> $LOGFILE

# Network interface status
echo "Network Interfaces:" >> $LOGFILE
ip addr show >> $LOGFILE
echo "" >> $LOGFILE

# Basic connectivity test
echo "Connectivity Test:" >> $LOGFILE
ping -c 4 8.8.8.8 >> $LOGFILE
echo "" >> $LOGFILE

# Current bandwidth usage
echo "Bandwidth Usage:" >> $LOGFILE
ifconfig | grep bytes >> $LOGFILE
```

Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x ~/network-diagnostics/scripts/network-health.sh
```

## Setting Up Advanced Diagnostic Tools

### Configuring SmokePing

1. Edit the SmokePing configuration:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/smokeping/config.d/Targets
```

Add your targets:

```text
+ LocalNetwork
menu = Local Network
title = Local Network Latency
++ Gateway
menu = Gateway
title = Gateway Latency
host = 192.168.1.1

++ GoogleDNS
menu = Google DNS
title = Google DNS Latency
host = 8.8.8.8
```

2. Restart SmokePing:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart smokeping
```

### Setting Up Regular Speed Tests

Create a speed test script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Save as ~/network-diagnostics/scripts/speed-test.sh

LOGFILE=~/network-diagnostics/logs/speedtest-$(date +%Y%m%d).log

echo "Speed Test Results - $(date)" > $LOGFILE
echo "------------------------" >> $LOGFILE

speedtest-cli --simple >> $LOGFILE
```

Add to crontab for regular testing:

```bash
0 */6 * * * ~/network-diagnostics/scripts/speed-test.sh
```

## Network Performance Monitoring

### Setting Up Performance Monitoring

1. Create a performance monitoring script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Save as ~/network-diagnostics/scripts/network-performance.sh

LOGFILE=~/network-diagnostics/logs/performance-$(date +%Y%m%d).log

echo "Network Performance Monitor - $(date)" > $LOGFILE
echo "------------------------" >> $LOGFILE

# Monitor network throughput
echo "Network Throughput:" >> $LOGFILE
iperf3 -c iperf.he.net >> $LOGFILE 2>&1
echo "" >> $LOGFILE

# Check for network errors
echo "Network Errors:" >> $LOGFILE
netstat -i >> $LOGFILE
echo "" >> $LOGFILE

# TCP connection statistics
echo "TCP Statistics:" >> $LOGFILE
netstat -st >> $LOGFILE
echo "" >> $LOGFILE
```

2. Configure regular execution:

```bash
chmod +x ~/network-diagnostics/scripts/network-performance.sh
```

## Real-Time Network Diagnostics

### Using MTR for Network Path Analysis

Create an MTR report script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Save as ~/network-diagnostics/scripts/mtr-report.sh

TARGET=$1
LOGFILE=~/network-diagnostics/logs/mtr-$(date +%Y%m%d)-${TARGET}.log

mtr -r -c 60 $TARGET > $LOGFILE
```

### Setting Up Network Port Scanning

Create a port scanning script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Save as ~/network-diagnostics/scripts/port-scan.sh

TARGET=$1
LOGFILE=~/network-diagnostics/logs/portscan-$(date +%Y%m%d)-${TARGET}.log

nmap -sT -p- $TARGET > $LOGFILE
```

## Creating a Network Diagnostic Dashboard

### Using System Monitoring Tools

1. Install system monitoring tools:

```bash
sudo apt install conky
```

2. Create a network monitoring configuration:

```text
# Save as ~/.conkyrc
conky.config = {
    alignment = 'top_right',
    background = true,
    update_interval = 2,
}

conky.text = [[
NETWORK ${hr 2}
eth0:
Down: ${downspeed eth0} ${alignr}Up: ${upspeed eth0}
Total: ${totaldown eth0} ${alignr}Total: ${totalup eth0}

wlan0:
Down: ${downspeed wlan0} ${alignr}Up: ${upspeed wlan0}
Total: ${totaldown wlan0} ${alignr}Total: ${totalup wlan0}

CONNECTIONS ${hr 2}
Inbound: ${tcp_port_monitor 1} ${alignr}Outbound: ${tcp_port_monitor 2}
]]
```

## Troubleshooting Common Network Issues

### Creating a Network Troubleshooting Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Save as ~/network-diagnostics/scripts/troubleshoot.sh

LOGFILE=~/network-diagnostics/logs/troubleshoot-$(date +%Y%m%d).log

echo "Network Troubleshooting Report - $(date)" > $LOGFILE
echo "--------------------------------" >> $LOGFILE

# Check DNS
echo "DNS Configuration:" >> $LOGFILE
cat /etc/resolv.conf >> $LOGFILE
echo "" >> $LOGFILE

# Check routing
echo "Routing Table:" >> $LOGFILE
ip route show >> $LOGFILE
echo "" >> $LOGFILE

# Check network interfaces
echo "Network Interfaces:" >> $LOGFILE
ip link show >> $LOGFILE
echo "" >> $LOGFILE

# Check network services
echo "Network Services:" >> $LOGFILE
sudo netstat -tulpn >> $LOGFILE
echo "" >> $LOGFILE

# Check firewall status
echo "Firewall Status:" >> $LOGFILE
sudo ufw status verbose >> $LOGFILE
```
