### **1. What is Angular 14?**

**Angular 14** is the latest iteration of Google’s Angular framework. It includes significant improvements like:

- **Standalone Components**: Simplifies module management by making components self-contained.
- **Typed Reactive Forms**: Adds strong typing to Angular forms, improving type safety and developer productivity.
- **Optional Injectors in Embedded Views**: Simplifies dependency injection for embedded views.
- **Extended Developer Command Line Interface (CLI)**: Enhances the commands for generating components, services, and other resources.

By leveraging Angular 14, you can create efficient, maintainable, and future-proof applications.

---

### **2. Prerequisites**

Before diving into the installation process, ensure you have:

1. A server or workstation running **AlmaLinux**.
2. **Root or sudo access** to install software and configure the system.
3. An active internet connection for downloading dependencies.
4. Familiarity with the command line and basic knowledge of web development.

---

### **3. Step 1: Update Your AlmaLinux System**

Keeping your system updated ensures you have the latest security patches and software versions. Use the following commands to update AlmaLinux:

```bash
sudo dnf update -y
sudo dnf upgrade -y
```

After the update, reboot your system to apply changes:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

---

### **4. Step 2: Install Node.js (LTS Version)**

Angular requires **Node.js** to run its development server and manage dependencies. For Angular 14, you’ll need Node.js version **16.x** or higher.

#### Step 4.1: Add the NodeSource Repository

Install Node.js 16 (or later) from the official NodeSource repository:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | sudo bash -
```

#### Step 4.2: Install Node.js

Install Node.js along with npm (Node Package Manager):

```bash
sudo dnf install -y nodejs
```

#### Step 4.3: Verify Installation

After installation, verify the versions of Node.js and npm:

```bash
node -v
```

Expected output:

```
v16.x.x
```

```bash
npm -v
```

---

### **5. Step 3: Install Angular CLI**

The **Angular CLI** (Command Line Interface) is a powerful tool that simplifies Angular project creation, management, and builds.

#### Step 5.1: Install Angular CLI

Install Angular CLI globally using npm:

```bash
sudo npm install -g @angular/cli
```

#### Step 5.2: Verify Angular CLI Installation

Check the installed version of Angular CLI to confirm it’s set up correctly:

```bash
ng version
```

Expected output:

```
Angular CLI: 14.x.x
```

---

### **6. Step 4: Create a New Angular Project**

Once the Angular CLI is installed, you can create a new Angular project.

#### Step 6.1: Generate a New Angular Project

Run the following command to create a new project. Replace `my-angular-app` with your desired project name:

```bash
ng new my-angular-app
```

The CLI will prompt you to:

1. Choose whether to add Angular routing (type `Yes` or `No` based on your requirements).
2. Select a stylesheet format (e.g., CSS, SCSS, or LESS).

#### Step 6.2: Navigate to the Project Directory

After the project is created, move into the project directory:

```bash
cd my-angular-app
```

---

### **7. Step 5: Serve and Test the Angular Application**

With the project set up, you can now serve it locally and test it.

#### Step 7.1: Start the Development Server

Run the following command to start the Angular development server:

```bash
ng serve
```

By default, the application will be available at `http://localhost:4200/`. If you're running on a remote server, you may need to bind the server to your system's IP address:

```bash
ng serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 4200
```

#### Step 7.2: Access the Application

Open a web browser and navigate to:

```
http://<your-server-ip>:4200/
```

You should see the default Angular welcome page. This confirms that your Angular 14 project is working correctly.

### **8. Step 6: Configure Angular for Production**

Before deploying your Angular application, it’s essential to build it for production.

#### Step 8.1: Build the Application

Use the following command to create a production-ready build of your Angular application:

```bash
ng build --configuration production
```

This command will generate optimized files in the `dist/` directory.

#### Step 8.2: Deploy the Application

You can deploy the contents of the `dist/` folder to a web server like Apache, Nginx, or a cloud platform.

##### Example: Deploying with Apache

1. Install Apache on AlmaLinux:

   ```bash
   sudo dnf install httpd -y
   sudo systemctl start httpd
   sudo systemctl enable httpd
   ```

2. Copy the built files to the Apache root directory:

   ```bash
   sudo cp -r dist/my-angular-app/* /var/www/html/
   ```

3. Adjust permissions:

   ```bash
   sudo chown -R apache:apache /var/www/html/
   ```

4. Restart Apache to serve the application:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart httpd
   ```

Your Angular application should now be accessible via your server's IP or domain.
