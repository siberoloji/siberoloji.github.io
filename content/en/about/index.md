I wrote a lot of content and published it on my website [www.siberoloji.com](https://www.siberoloji.com) with WordPress until my post count reached a significant point. After that, the speed and database issues started to bother me. 
When I analyzed Core Web Vitals results, I saw that page load speed is becoming poor. I decided to use cache and minifying plugins on WordPress, which caused css and styling issues. Every blog post addition began to be a nightmare on the backend.
Finally, I paused adding new posts to WordPress and began to write with HUGO Static Site Generator under this domain.
You can find new blog posts and documented formats of some topics. I will give it a try. That's all about.
