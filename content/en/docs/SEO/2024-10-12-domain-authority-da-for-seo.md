**Understanding Domain Authority**



Domain Authority (DA), a metric developed by Moz, is a predictive score that estimates a website's ability to rank in search engine results pages (SERPs). It's a logarithmic scale ranging from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating a greater likelihood of ranking well. While DA isn't a direct Google ranking factor, it's a valuable tool for understanding a website's competitive landscape.

Moz's algorithm calculates DA based on numerous factors, including:


* **Linking Root Domains:** The number of unique domains linking to your site.
