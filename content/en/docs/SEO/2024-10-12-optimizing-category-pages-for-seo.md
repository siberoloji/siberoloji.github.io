In the competitive landscape of online marketing, search engine optimization (SEO) plays a crucial role in driving organic traffic to your website. While many focus on optimizing individual product or blog pages, often overlooked is the importance of category pages. These pages serve as a gateway to your website's content, offering a structured overview of your products or services. By optimizing your category pages, you can enhance your website's visibility, improve user experience, and boost your overall SEO performance.
