Managing network drives effectively is essential for users who need to access shared resources across a network. This comprehensive guide will walk you through the process of setting up, managing, and troubleshooting network drives on Linux Mint with Cinnamon Desktop.

## Prerequisites

First, let's install necessary packages for network drive management:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install cifs-utils nfs-common samba smbclient gvfs-backends
```

This installs:

- cifs-utils: Common Internet File System utilities
- nfs-common: NFS client tools
- samba: SMB/CIFS file sharing
- smbclient: SMB/CIFS client
- gvfs-backends: Virtual filesystem support

## Accessing Network Drives Through Cinnamon Desktop

### Using the GUI File Manager (Nemo)

1. Open Nemo file manager
2. Press Ctrl+L to show the location bar
3. Enter the network location:
   - For Windows shares: `smb://server/share`
   - For NFS shares: `nfs://server/share`
   - For WebDAV: `davs://server/share`

### Connecting to Network Shares

1. Browse Network Shares:
   - Click "Network" in Nemo's sidebar
   - Browse available workgroups and servers
   - Double-click to mount shares

2. Connect to Server:
   - Click File → Connect to Server
   - Enter server address
   - Choose connection type
   - Enter credentials if required

## Mounting Network Drives Permanently

### Setting Up CIFS/SMB Shares

1. Create mount point:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/network-share
```

2. Edit fstab configuration:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/fstab
```

3. Add mount configuration:

```text
# Windows Share
//server/share /mnt/network-share cifs credentials=/etc/samba/credentials,iocharset=utf8,uid=1000,gid=1000 0 0
```

4. Create credentials file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/samba/credentials
```

5. Add credentials:

```text
username=your_username
password=your_password
domain=your_domain
```

6. Secure credentials file:

```bash
sudo chmod 600 /etc/samba/credentials
```

### Setting Up NFS Shares

1. Create mount point:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/nfs-share
```

2. Add to fstab:

```text
server:/share /mnt/nfs-share nfs defaults,_netdev 0 0
```

## Advanced Network Drive Configuration

### Auto-mounting Network Drives

1. Create systemd mount unit:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/mnt-network-share.mount
```

2. Configure mount unit:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Network Share Mount
After=network-online.target
Wants=network-online.target

[Mount]
What=//server/share
Where=/mnt/network-share
Type=cifs
Options=credentials=/etc/samba/credentials,iocharset=utf8,uid=1000,gid=1000

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

3. Enable and start the mount:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable mnt-network-share.mount
sudo systemctl start mnt-network-share.mount
```

### Creating Network Drive Scripts

1. Mount script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Save as ~/scripts/mount-network.sh

# Check network connectivity
ping -c 1 server > /dev/null 2>&1
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    # Mount the share
    mount -t cifs //server/share /mnt/network-share -o credentials=/etc/samba/credentials
    echo "Network drive mounted successfully"
else
    echo "Server not reachable"
fi
```

2. Unmount script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Save as ~/scripts/unmount-network.sh

# Safely unmount the share
umount -l /mnt/network-share
echo "Network drive unmounted"
```

## Performance Optimization

### Configuring Mount Options

1. Performance-optimized CIFS mount:

```text
//server/share /mnt/network-share cifs credentials=/etc/samba/credentials,iocharset=utf8,uid=1000,gid=1000,cache=strict,actimeo=30,noatime 0 0
```

2. Performance-optimized NFS mount:

```text
server:/share /mnt/nfs-share nfs rsize=8192,wsize=8192,timeo=14,noatime 0 0
```

### Cache Configuration

1. Create cache directory:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /var/cache/network-shares
```

2. Configure caching:

```bash
# Add to fstab
//server/share /mnt/network-share cifs credentials=/etc/samba/credentials,cache=loose,dir_mode=0777,file_mode=0777 0 0
```

## Troubleshooting Network Drives

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. Connection problems:

```bash
# Test connectivity
ping server

# Check SMB service
smbclient -L server -U username

# Test NFS connectivity
showmount -e server
```

2. Permission issues:

```bash
# Check current permissions
ls -l /mnt/network-share

# Fix ownership
sudo chown -R username:group /mnt/network-share

# Fix permissions
sudo chmod -R 755 /mnt/network-share
```

### Creating a Diagnostic Tool

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Save as network-drive-diagnostic.sh

LOGFILE="network-drive-diagnostic.log"

echo "Network Drive Diagnostic Report - $(date)" > $LOGFILE
echo "--------------------------------" >> $LOGFILE

# Check mounted drives
echo "Mounted Drives:" >> $LOGFILE
mount | grep -E "cifs|nfs" >> $LOGFILE

# Check network connectivity
echo -e "\nNetwork Connectivity:" >> $LOGFILE
ping -c 4 server >> $LOGFILE

# Check SMB/CIFS status
echo -e "\nSMB/CIFS Status:" >> $LOGFILE
smbstatus >> $LOGFILE

# Check available shares
echo -e "\nAvailable Shares:" >> $LOGFILE
smbclient -L server -N >> $LOGFILE

# Check system logs
echo -e "\nRelated System Logs:" >> $LOGFILE
journalctl | grep -E "cifs|nfs" | tail -n 50 >> $LOGFILE
```

## Best Practices and Maintenance

### Regular Maintenance Tasks

1. Create maintenance script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Save as network-drive-maintenance.sh

# Check and repair connections
for mount in $(mount | grep -E "cifs|nfs" | cut -d' ' -f3); do
    if ! df $mount > /dev/null 2>&1; then
        echo "Remounting $mount"
        mount -a
    fi
done

# Clear cache if needed
if [ $(df /var/cache/network-shares | tail -n1 | awk '{print $5}' | sed 's/%//') -gt 90 ]; then
    echo "Clearing network share cache"
    rm -rf /var/cache/network-shares/*
fi
```

2. Schedule maintenance:

```bash
# Add to crontab
0 * * * * /path/to/network-drive-maintenance.sh
```
