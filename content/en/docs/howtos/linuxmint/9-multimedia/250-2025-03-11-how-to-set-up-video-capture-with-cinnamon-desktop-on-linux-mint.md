## Tips for High-Quality Video Capture

To ensure your recordings are of the highest quality, consider the following tips:

1. **Optimize System Performance**:
   - Close unnecessary applications to free up system resources.
   - Use a lightweight desktop environment if you experience lag during recording.

2. **Choose the Right Resolution and Frame Rate**:
   - For most purposes, 1080p at 30 FPS is sufficient. For smoother motion, consider 60 FPS.

3. **Use a High-Quality Microphone**:
   - If recording voiceovers or commentary, invest in a good microphone for clear audio.

4. **Test Before Recording**:
   - Always do a test recording to check audio levels, video quality, and framing.

5. **Edit Your Recordings**:
   - Use video editing software like **Kdenlive** or **OpenShot** to trim, add effects, or enhance your recordings.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

1. **No Audio in Recordings**:
   - Ensure the correct audio source is selected in your recording software.
   - Check your system’s audio settings to confirm the output device is properly configured.

2. **Lag or Stuttering**:
   - Lower the recording resolution or frame rate.
   - Close background applications to free up CPU and GPU resources.

3. **Black Screen in Display Capture**:
