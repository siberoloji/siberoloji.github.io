## Introduction to Disk Partitioning

Disk partitioning is a crucial skill for Linux users, allowing efficient storage management and system optimization. GParted, a powerful graphical partition editor, provides Linux Mint users with comprehensive tools for disk management.

## Understanding Partitions and File Systems

### Partition Basics

- A partition is a logical division of a physical storage device
- Each partition can have a different file system
- Allows multiple operating systems or data organization

### Common File Systems

- **ext4**: Default for Linux systems
- **NTFS**: Windows compatibility
- **FAT32**: Universal, limited file size
- **exFAT**: Large file support

## Installing GParted

### Creating Partitions

1. Select unallocated space
2. Right-click → New
3. Choose:
   - File system type
   - Partition size
   - Label
4. Apply changes

### Resizing Partitions

- Drag partition boundaries
- Adjust size precisely
- Supported for most file systems
- Recommended: Backup data first

### Moving Partitions

- Drag and drop in GParted interface
