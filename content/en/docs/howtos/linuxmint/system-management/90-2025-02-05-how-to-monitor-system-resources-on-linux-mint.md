## Introduction

Linux Mint is a popular Linux distribution known for its user-friendliness, stability, and efficiency. Whether you're a casual user or a system administrator, monitoring system resources is essential to maintain optimal performance, troubleshoot issues, and ensure your system's health. System resource monitoring includes tracking CPU usage, memory consumption, disk activity, network performance, and running processes.

In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore various tools and techniques to monitor system resources on Linux Mint, covering both graphical user interface (GUI) applications and command-line utilities. This will help you identify performance bottlenecks, manage system load, and optimize your Linux Mint experience.

## Why Monitoring System Resources is Important

Monitoring system resources is crucial for several reasons:

CPU=$(top -bn1 | grep "Cpu(s)" | awk '{print $2 + $4}')
if (( ${CPU%.*} > THRESHOLD )); then
  echo "High CPU usage: $CPU%" | mail -s "CPU Alert" user@example.com
fi
```

- Save this script as `cpu_alert.sh`.
- Make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x cpu_alert.sh
```

- Schedule with cron for regular checks:

```bash
crontab -e
*/5 * * * * /path/to/cpu_alert.sh
