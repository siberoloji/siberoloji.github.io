A corrupted FreeBSD installation can be a stressful situation for system administrators and users alike. Whether caused by hardware failure, improper shutdown, filesystem corruption, or botched updates, a system that refuses to boot properly requires methodical troubleshooting and recovery procedures. Fortunately, FreeBSD provides robust tools and mechanisms that can help you recover your system without resorting to a complete reinstallation.

This guide will walk you through a comprehensive recovery process, covering various corruption scenarios and their remedies. By following these steps, you'll be equipped to diagnose and resolve most FreeBSD system corruption issues.

## Understanding Types of System Corruption

Before diving into recovery procedures, it's important to understand the different ways a FreeBSD system can become corrupted:

1. **Boot loader corruption**: Problems with the boot code in the MBR (Master Boot Record) or GPT (GUID Partition Table) preventing the system from initializing the boot process.

2. **Filesystem corruption**: Damage to UFS, ZFS, or other filesystem structures, often caused by improper shutdowns or power failures.

3. **Kernel corruption**: Problems with the kernel or kernel modules that prevent proper system operation.

4. **Configuration corruption**: Incorrect settings in critical configuration files like `/etc/rc.conf`, `/etc/fstab`, or boot loader configurations.

5. **Package or software corruption**: Issues with installed software or packages that render the system unusable.

Each type of corruption requires different recovery approaches, which we'll explore in this guide.

## Prerequisites for Recovery

Before beginning the recovery process, gather these essentials:

- FreeBSD installation media (USB drive or DVD) matching your installed version (or close to it)
- External storage device for backups (if possible)
- Hardware documentation for your system
- Network connectivity (helpful but not always required)
- Time and patience

## Booting into Single-User Mode

For many recovery scenarios, single-user mode is your first option:

1. Restart your system
2. At the FreeBSD boot menu, select "Boot FreeBSD in Single-User Mode"
3. If prompted, enter the path to the shell (usually just press Enter to accept the default `/bin/sh`)

Single-user mode provides a minimal environment with the root filesystem mounted read-only, allowing for filesystem checks and basic repairs.

```
# Mount the root filesystem in read-write mode
mount -u /

# Mount other critical filesystems
mount -a -t ufs
swapon -a
```

If these commands succeed, your filesystem structure may be intact, and the issue could be related to configuration or software.

## Using FreeBSD Recovery Media

If single-user mode is inaccessible, boot from your FreeBSD installation media:

1. Insert your FreeBSD installation media and boot from it
2. From the FreeBSD installer menu, select "Live CD" or "Shell" (depending on the version)
3. You'll now have access to a complete FreeBSD environment for diagnosis and repair

## Diagnosing Filesystem Corruption

Filesystem corruption is one of the most common issues. Here's how to check and repair it:

### For UFS Filesystems

1. Identify your partitions:

```
gpart show
```

2. Run filesystem check on the root partition (typically ada0p2 for the first disk's second partition, but verify with `gpart show`):

```
fsck -y /dev/ada0p2
```

3. Check all UFS filesystems referenced in `/etc/fstab`:

```
fsck -y -t ufs
```

The `-y` flag automatically answers "yes" to all repair questions, which is usually safe but be cautious on critical systems.

### For ZFS Filesystems

1. Import and check your ZFS pool (commonly "zroot"):

```
zpool import -f zroot
zpool status zroot
```

2. If errors are reported, try a repair:

```
zpool scrub zroot
```

3. For more severe corruption:

```
zpool clear zroot
```

4. If the pool cannot be imported normally, try recovery mode:

```
zpool import -fF zroot
```

## Repairing Boot Loader Issues

If your system won't boot due to boot loader corruption:

1. Boot from installation media and access the shell
2. For GPT-based systems:

```
gpart bootcode -b /boot/pmbr -p /boot/gptboot -i 1 ada0
```

3. For MBR-based systems:

```
gpart bootcode -b /boot/mbr ada0
```

4. If using ZFS with UEFI:

```
mount -t msdosfs /dev/ada0p1 /mnt
cp /boot/loader.efi /mnt/efi/boot/BOOTx64.efi
umount /mnt
```

## Fixing Configuration Corruption

Improper configuration changes can prevent a system from booting properly:

### For rc.conf Issues

1. Mount your root filesystem (if not already mounted):

```
mount /dev/ada0p2 /mnt
```

2. Edit the configuration file:

```
ee /mnt/etc/rc.conf
```

3. Look for syntax errors or problematic service configurations

### For Loader Configuration

1. Examine and repair loader configuration:

```
ee /mnt/boot/loader.conf
```

2. Remove any problematic module loading or configuration entries

### For fstab Issues

1. Check filesystem table configuration:

```
ee /mnt/etc/fstab
```

2. Verify UUIDs, device names, and mount options

## Kernel and World Recovery

If your kernel or base system components are corrupted, you may need to reinstall them:

1. Boot from installation media
2. Mount your existing installation:

```
mount /dev/ada0p2 /mnt
mount -t devfs devfs /mnt/dev
```

3. Chroot into your installation:

```
chroot /mnt
```

4. Reinstall the kernel:

```
cd /usr/src
make kernel KERNCONF=GENERIC
```

5. If the entire base system needs rebuilding:

```
cd /usr/src
make buildworld
make installworld
```

Note that this requires having the FreeBSD source code available. If it's not present, you can install it from installation media or fetch it using Git:

```
pkg install git
git clone https://git.freebsd.org/src.git /usr/src
cd /usr/src
git checkout release/13.2  # Replace with your FreeBSD version
```

## Recovering from Failed Updates

Failed system updates can leave your system in an inconsistent state:

1. Boot into single-user mode or from installation media
2. Mount all filesystems and chroot if necessary
3. If a freebsd-update failed, you can try to roll back:

```
freebsd-update rollback
```

4. For ports or package issues:

```
pkg check -dsa
pkg upgrade -f
```

5. If the ABI changed (such as during a major version upgrade), reinstall all packages:

```
pkg-static upgrade -f
```

## Encrypted System Recovery

If you're using GELI encryption, additional steps are needed:

1. Boot from installation media
2. Load the GELI module:

```
kldload geom_eli
```

3. Attach your encrypted partitions:

```
geli attach /dev/ada0p2
```

4. Mount the decrypted filesystem:

```
mount /dev/ada0p2.eli /mnt
```

5. Proceed with the appropriate recovery methods

## Data Recovery When All Else Fails

If you can't recover the system but need to save your data:

1. Boot from live media
2. Mount your filesystems read-only to prevent further damage:

```
mount -o ro /dev/ada0p2 /mnt
```

3. Copy important data to an external drive:

```
mkdir /tmp/backup
mount /dev/da0 /tmp/backup  # Assuming da0 is your external drive
cp -Rpv /mnt/home/* /tmp/backup/
```

4. Consider using specialized data recovery tools:

```
pkg install testdisk recoverdm
```

## Preventive Measures for the Future

After recovery, implement these preventive measures:

1. Regular backups using `dump`, `tar`, or `rsync`
2. For ZFS systems, regular snapshots:

```
zfs snapshot zroot/usr/home@daily
```

3. Configure periodic filesystem checks in `/etc/periodic.conf`
4. Use UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) for protection against power failures
5. Maintain a rescue USB drive with your system's configuration files
6. Document your system's partition layout and critical configurations

## Testing Your Recovered System

Before considering your system fully recovered:

1. Reboot into normal multi-user mode
2. Check system logs for errors:

```
dmesg | grep -i error
cat /var/log/messages
```

3. Verify all filesystems are correctly mounted:

```
mount
df -h
```

4. Test critical system services:

```
service -e
```

5. Run basic system diagnostics:

```
uname -a
uptime
top -b
```
