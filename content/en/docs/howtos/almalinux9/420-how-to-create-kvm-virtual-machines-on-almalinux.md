### How to Create KVM Virtual Machines on AlmaLinux: A Step-by-Step Guide

Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) is one of the most reliable and powerful virtualization solutions available for Linux systems. By using KVM on AlmaLinux, administrators can create and manage virtual machines (VMs) with ease, enabling them to run multiple operating systems simultaneously on a single physical machine.

In this guide, we’ll walk you through the entire process of creating a KVM virtual machine on AlmaLinux. From installation to configuration, we’ll cover everything you need to know to get started with virtualization.

### **What is KVM?**

KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution that transforms a Linux system into a hypervisor. Leveraging the hardware virtualization features of modern CPUs (Intel VT-x or AMD-V), KVM allows users to run isolated VMs with their own operating systems and applications.

**Key Features of KVM:**

- **Efficient Performance**: Native virtualization using hardware extensions.
- **Flexibility**: Supports various guest OSes, including Linux, Windows, and BSD.
- **Scalability**: Manage multiple VMs on a single host.
- **Integration**: Seamless management using tools like `virsh` and `virt-manager`.

---

### **Step 1: Prerequisites**

Before creating a virtual machine, ensure your system meets these requirements:

1. **System Requirements**:
   - A 64-bit processor with virtualization extensions (Intel VT-x or AMD-V).
   - At least 4 GB of RAM (8 GB or more recommended for multiple VMs).
   - Sufficient disk space for hosting VM storage.

2. **Verify Virtualization Support**:
   Check if the CPU supports virtualization:

   ```bash
   lscpu | grep Virtualization
   ```

   If `VT-x` (Intel) or `AMD-V` (AMD) appears in the output, your CPU supports virtualization. If not, enable it in the BIOS/UEFI.

3. **Installed KVM and Required Tools**:
   KVM and its management tools must already be installed. If not, follow our guide on [How to Install KVM on AlmaLinux](/how-to-install-kvm-almalinux/).

---

### **Step 2: Preparing the Environment**

Before creating a virtual machine, ensure your KVM environment is ready:

1. **Start and Enable Libvirt**:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable libvirtd
   sudo systemctl start libvirtd
   ```

2. **Check Virtualization Modules**:
   Ensure KVM modules are loaded:

   ```bash
   lsmod | grep kvm
   ```

   Look for `kvm_intel` or `kvm_amd`.

3. **Download the Installation Media**:
   Download the ISO file of the operating system you want to install. For example:
   - AlmaLinux: [Download ISO](https://almalinux.org/download/)

---

### **Step 3: Creating a KVM Virtual Machine Using Virt-Manager (GUI)**

Virt-Manager is a graphical tool that simplifies VM creation and management.

1. **Launch Virt-Manager**:
   Install and start Virt-Manager:

   ```bash
   sudo dnf install virt-manager -y
   virt-manager
   ```

2. **Connect to the Hypervisor**:
   In the Virt-Manager interface, connect to the local hypervisor (usually listed as `QEMU/KVM`).

3. **Start the New VM Wizard**:
   - Click **Create a New Virtual Machine**.
   - Select **Local install media (ISO image or CDROM)** and click **Forward**.

4. **Choose Installation Media**:
   - Browse and select the ISO file of your desired operating system.
   - Choose the OS variant (e.g., AlmaLinux or CentOS).

5. **Allocate Resources**:
   - Assign memory (RAM) and CPU cores to the VM.
   - For example, allocate 2 GB RAM and 2 CPU cores for a lightweight VM.

6. **Create a Virtual Disk**:
   - Specify the storage size for the VM (e.g., 20 GB).
   - Choose the storage format (e.g., `qcow2` for efficient storage).

7. **Network Configuration**:
   - Use the default network bridge (NAT) for internet access.
   - For advanced setups, configure a custom bridge.

8. **Finalize and Start Installation**:
   - Review the VM settings.
   - Click **Finish** to start the VM and launch the OS installer.

### **Step 4: Creating a KVM Virtual Machine Using Virt-Install (CLI)**

For users who prefer the command line, the `virt-install` utility is an excellent choice.

1. **Create a Virtual Disk**:

   ```bash
   sudo qemu-img create -f qcow2 /var/lib/libvirt/images/testvm.qcow2 20G
   ```

2. **Run Virt-Install**:
   Execute the following command to create and start the VM:

   ```bash
   sudo virt-install \
     --name testvm \
     --ram 2048 \
     --vcpus 2 \
     --disk path=/var/lib/libvirt/images/testvm.qcow2,size=20 \
     --os-type linux \
     --os-variant almalinux8 \
     --network bridge=virbr0 \
     --graphics vnc \
     --cdrom /path/to/almalinux.iso
   ```

   Replace `/path/to/almalinux.iso` with the path to your ISO file.

3. **Access the VM Console**:
   Use `virsh` or a VNC viewer to access the VM:

   ```bash
   sudo virsh list
   sudo virsh console testvm
   ```

### **Step 5: Managing Virtual Machines**

After creating a VM, use these commands to manage it:

1. **List Running VMs**:

   ```bash
   sudo virsh list
   ```

2. **Start or Stop a VM**:
   - Start:

     ```bash
     sudo virsh start testvm
     ```

   - Stop:

     ```bash
     sudo virsh shutdown testvm
     ```

3. **Edit VM Configuration**:
   Modify settings such as CPU or memory allocation:

   ```bash
   sudo virsh edit testvm
   ```

4. **Delete a VM**:
   Undefine and remove the VM:

   ```bash
   sudo virsh undefine testvm
   sudo rm -f /var/lib/libvirt/images/testvm.qcow2
   ```

---

### **Step 6: Troubleshooting Common Issues**

1. **Issue: "KVM Not Found"**:
   - Ensure the KVM modules are loaded:

     ```bash
     sudo modprobe kvm
     ```

2. **Issue: Virtual Machine Won’t Start**:
   - Check system logs for errors:

     ```bash
     sudo journalctl -xe
     ```

3. **Issue: No Internet Access for the VM**:
   - Ensure the `virbr0` network is active:

     ```bash
     sudo virsh net-list
     ```

4. **Issue: Poor VM Performance**:
   - Enable nested virtualization:

     ```bash
     echo "options kvm_intel nested=1" | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/kvm.conf
     sudo modprobe -r kvm_intel
     sudo modprobe kvm_intel
     ```
