### How to Install KVM VM Management Tools on AlmaLinux: A Complete Guide

Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) is a robust virtualization platform available in Linux. While KVM is powerful, managing virtual machines (VMs) efficiently requires specialized tools. AlmaLinux, being an enterprise-grade Linux distribution, provides several tools to simplify the process of creating, managing, and monitoring KVM virtual machines.

In this guide, we’ll explore the installation and setup of KVM VM management tools on AlmaLinux. Whether you prefer a graphical user interface (GUI) or command-line interface (CLI), this post will help you get started.

### **Why Use KVM Management Tools?**

KVM management tools offer a user-friendly way to handle complex virtualization tasks, making them accessible to both seasoned administrators and newcomers. Here’s what they bring to the table:

- **Simplified VM Creation**: Step-by-step wizards for creating VMs.
- **Resource Management**: Tools to allocate and monitor CPU, memory, and disk usage.
- **Snapshots and Backups**: Easy ways to create and revert snapshots.
- **Remote Management**: Manage VMs from a central system.

---

### **Step 1: Prerequisites**

Before installing KVM management tools, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

1. **System Requirements**:
   - AlmaLinux 8 or later.
   - A 64-bit processor with virtualization support (Intel VT-x or AMD-V).
   - Sufficient RAM (4 GB or more recommended) and disk space.

2. **KVM Installed**:
   - KVM, libvirt, and QEMU must be installed and running. Follow our guide on [Installing KVM on AlmaLinux](/how-to-install-kvm-almalinux/).

3. **Administrative Access**:
   - Root or sudo privileges are required.

4. **Network Connectivity**:
   - Ensure the system has a stable internet connection to download packages.

### **Step 2: Install Core KVM Management Tools**

#### 1. **Install Libvirt**

Libvirt is a key component for managing KVM virtual machines. It provides a unified interface for interacting with the virtualization layer.

Install Libvirt using the following command:

```bash
sudo dnf install -y libvirt libvirt-devel
```

Start and enable the libvirt service:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable libvirtd
sudo systemctl start libvirtd
```

Verify that libvirt is running:

```bash
sudo systemctl status libvirtd
```

#### 2. **Install Virt-Manager (GUI Tool)**

Virt-Manager (Virtual Machine Manager) is a GUI application for managing KVM virtual machines. It simplifies the process of creating and managing VMs.

Install Virt-Manager:

```bash
sudo dnf install -y virt-manager
```

Launch Virt-Manager from the terminal:

```bash
virt-manager
```

Alternatively, search for **"Virtual Machine Manager"** in your desktop environment’s application menu.

#### 3. **Install Virt-Install (CLI Tool)**

Virt-Install is a command-line utility for creating VMs. It is especially useful for automation and script-based management.

Install Virt-Install:

```bash
sudo dnf install -y virt-install
```

---

### **Step 3: Optional Management Tools**

#### 1. **Cockpit (Web Interface)**

Cockpit provides a modern web interface for managing Linux systems, including KVM virtual machines.

Install Cockpit:

```bash
sudo dnf install -y cockpit cockpit-machines
```

Start and enable the Cockpit service:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now cockpit.socket
```

Access Cockpit in your browser by navigating to:

```plaintext
https://<server-ip>:9090
```

Log in with your system credentials and navigate to the **Virtual Machines** tab.

#### 2. **Virt-Top (Resource Monitoring)**

Virt-Top is a CLI-based tool for monitoring the performance of VMs, similar to `top`.

Install Virt-Top:

```bash
sudo dnf install -y virt-top
```

Run Virt-Top:

```bash
sudo virt-top
```

#### 3. **Kimchi (Web-Based Management)**

Kimchi is an open-source, HTML5-based management tool for KVM. It provides an easy-to-use web interface for managing VMs.

Install Kimchi and dependencies:

```bash
sudo dnf install -y kimchi
```

Start the Kimchi service:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now kimchid
```

Access Kimchi at:

```plaintext
https://<server-ip>:8001
```

### **Step 4: Configure User Access**

By default, only the root user can manage VMs. To allow non-root users access, add them to the `libvirt` group:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG libvirt $(whoami)
```

Log out and back in for the changes to take effect.

---

### **Step 5: Create a Test Virtual Machine**

After installing the tools, create a test VM to verify the setup.

#### Using Virt-Manager (GUI)

1. Launch Virt-Manager:

   ```bash
   virt-manager
   ```

2. Click **Create a New Virtual Machine**.
3. Select the **Local install media (ISO image)** option.
4. Choose the ISO file of your preferred OS.
5. Allocate resources (CPU, memory, disk).
6. Configure networking.
7. Complete the setup and start the VM.

#### Using Virt-Install (CLI)

Run the following command to create a VM:

```bash
sudo virt-install \
  --name testvm \
  --ram 2048 \
  --vcpus 2 \
  --disk path=/var/lib/libvirt/images/testvm.qcow2,size=20 \
  --os-variant almalinux8 \
  --cdrom /path/to/almalinux.iso
```

Replace `/path/to/almalinux.iso` with the path to your OS ISO.

---

### **Step 6: Manage and Monitor Virtual Machines**

#### Start, Stop, and Restart VMs

Using `virsh` (CLI):

```bash
sudo virsh list --all       # List all VMs
sudo virsh start testvm     # Start a VM
sudo virsh shutdown testvm  # Stop a VM
sudo virsh reboot testvm    # Restart a VM
```

Using Virt-Manager (GUI):

- Select a VM and click **Run**, **Shut Down**, or **Reboot**.

#### Monitor Resource Usage

Using Virt-Top:

```bash
sudo virt-top
```

Using Cockpit:

- Navigate to the **Virtual Machines** tab to monitor performance metrics.

### **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

1. **Issue: "KVM Not Found"**
   - Ensure the KVM modules are loaded:

     ```bash
     sudo modprobe kvm
     ```

2. **Issue: Libvirt Service Fails to Start**
   - Check logs for errors:

     ```bash
     sudo journalctl -xe
     ```

3. **Issue: VM Creation Fails**
   - Verify that your system has enough resources (CPU, RAM, and disk space).
   - Check the permissions of your ISO file or disk image.

---
