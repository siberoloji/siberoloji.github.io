**How to Use SELinux sesearch for Basic Usage on AlmaLinux**  

SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux) is a powerful feature in AlmaLinux that enforces strict security policies to safeguard systems from unauthorized access. However, SELinux’s complexity can sometimes make it challenging for system administrators to troubleshoot and manage. This is where the `sesearch` tool comes into play. The `sesearch` command enables users to query SELinux policies and retrieve detailed information about rules, permissions, and relationships.  

This guide will walk you through the basics of using `sesearch` on AlmaLinux, helping you effectively query SELinux policies and enhance your system’s security management.  

---

### **What is SELinux sesearch?**  

The `sesearch` command is a utility in the SELinux toolset that allows you to query SELinux policy rules. It provides detailed insights into how SELinux policies are configured, including:  

- **Allowed actions**: What actions are permitted between subjects (processes) and objects (files, ports, etc.).  
- **Booleans**: How SELinux booleans influence policy behavior.  
- **Types and Attributes**: The relationships between SELinux types and attributes.  

By using `sesearch`, you can troubleshoot SELinux denials, analyze policies, and better understand the underlying configurations.  

---

### **Why Use SELinux sesearch on AlmaLinux?**  

- **Troubleshooting**: Pinpoint why an SELinux denial occurred by examining policy rules.  
- **Policy Analysis**: Gain insights into allowed interactions between subjects and objects.  
- **Boolean Examination**: Understand how SELinux booleans modify behavior dynamically.  
- **Enhanced Security**: Verify and audit SELinux rules for compliance.  

---

### **Prerequisites**  

Before using `sesearch`, ensure the following:  

1. **SELinux is Enabled**: Check SELinux status with:  

   ```bash
   sestatus
   ```  

   The output should indicate that SELinux is in **Enforcing** or **Permissive** mode.  

2. **Install Required Tools**: Install `policycoreutils` and `setools-console`, which include `sesearch`:  

   ```bash
   sudo dnf install policycoreutils setools-console -y
   ```  

3. **Sufficient Privileges**: Root or sudo access is necessary for querying policies.  

---

### **Basic Syntax of sesearch**  

The basic syntax for the `sesearch` command is:  

```bash
sesearch [OPTIONS] [FILTERS]
```  

#### Common Options  

- **`-A`**: Include all rules.  
- **`-b BOOLEAN`**: Display rules dependent on a specific SELinux boolean.  
- **`-s SOURCE_TYPE`**: Specify the source (subject) type.  
- **`-t TARGET_TYPE`**: Specify the target (object) type.  
- **`-c CLASS`**: Filter by a specific object class (e.g., `file`, `dir`, `port`).  
- **`--allow`**: Show only `allow` rules.  

---

### **Step-by-Step Guide to Using sesearch on AlmaLinux**  

#### **Step 1: Query Allowed Interactions**  

To identify which actions are permitted between a source type and a target type, use the `--allow` flag.  

**Example**: Check which actions the `httpd_t` type can perform on files labeled `httpd_sys_content_t`.  

```bash
sesearch --allow -s httpd_t -t httpd_sys_content_t -c file
```  

**Output**:  

```plaintext
allow httpd_t httpd_sys_content_t:file { read getattr open };
```  

This output shows that processes with the `httpd_t` type can read, get attributes, and open files labeled with `httpd_sys_content_t`.  

---

#### **Step 2: Query Rules Dependent on Booleans**  

SELinux booleans modify policy rules dynamically. Use the `-b` option to view rules associated with a specific boolean.  

**Example**: Check rules affected by the `httpd_enable_cgi` boolean.  

```bash
sesearch -b httpd_enable_cgi
```  

**Output**:  

```plaintext
Found 2 conditional av rules.
...
allow httpd_t httpd_sys_script_exec_t:file { execute getattr open read };
```

This output shows that enabling the `httpd_enable_cgi` boolean allows `httpd_t` processes to execute script files labeled with `httpd_sys_script_exec_t`.  

---

#### **Step 3: Query All Rules for a Type**  

To display all rules that apply to a specific type, omit the filters and use the `-s` or `-t` options.  

**Example**: View all rules for the `ssh_t` source type.  

```bash
sesearch -A -s ssh_t
```  

---

#### **Step 4: Analyze Denials**  

When a denial occurs, use `sesearch` to check the policy for allowed actions.  

**Scenario**: An application running under `myapp_t` is denied access to a log file labeled `var_log_t`.  

1. **Check Policy Rules**:  

   ```bash
   sesearch --allow -s myapp_t -t var_log_t -c file
   ```  

2. **Analyze Output**:  
   If no `allow` rules exist for the requested action (e.g., `write`), the policy must be updated.  

---

#### **Step 5: Combine Filters**  

You can combine multiple filters to refine your queries further.  

**Example**: Query rules where `httpd_t` can interact with `httpd_sys_content_t` for the `file` class, dependent on the `httpd_enable_homedirs` boolean.  

```bash
sesearch --allow -s httpd_t -t httpd_sys_content_t -c file -b httpd_enable_homedirs
```  

---

### **Best Practices for Using sesearch**  

1. **Use Specific Filters**: Narrow down queries by specifying source, target, class, and boolean filters.  
2. **Understand Booleans**: Familiarize yourself with SELinux booleans using:  

   ```bash
   getsebool -a
   ```  

3. **Document Queries**: Keep a log of `sesearch` commands and outputs for auditing purposes.  
4. **Verify Policy Changes**: Always test the impact of policy changes in a non-production environment.

### **Real-World Scenarios for sesearch Usage**  

#### **1. Debugging Web Server Access Issues**  

**Problem**: Apache cannot access files in `/var/www/html`.  

**Steps**:  

1. Check current file context:  

   ```bash
   ls -Z /var/www/html
   ```  

2. Query policy rules for `httpd_t` interacting with `httpd_sys_content_t`:  

   ```bash
   sesearch --allow -s httpd_t -t httpd_sys_content_t -c file
   ```  

3. Enable relevant booleans if needed:  

   ```bash
   sudo setsebool -P httpd_enable_homedirs 1
   ```  

---

#### **2. Diagnosing SSH Service Denials**  

**Problem**: SSH service fails to read custom configuration files.  

**Steps**:  

1. Check the SELinux context of the configuration file:  

   ```bash
   ls -Z /etc/ssh/custom_config
   ```  

2. Query policy rules for `ssh_t` and the file’s label:  

   ```bash
   sesearch --allow -s ssh_t -t ssh_config_t -c file
   ```  

3. Restore file context if mismatched:  

   ```bash
   sudo restorecon -v /etc/ssh/custom_config
   ```

### **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)**  

#### **1. What is the difference between sesearch and audit2allow?**  

- `sesearch`: Queries existing SELinux policy rules.  
- `audit2allow`: Generates policy rules based on logged denials.  

#### **2. Can sesearch modify SELinux policies?**  

No, `sesearch` is a read-only tool. Use `semanage` or `audit2allow` to modify policies.  

#### **3. How can I check all booleans affecting a type?**  

Combine `sesearch` with the `-s` and `-b` options to query booleans related to a specific source type.  

#### **4. Is sesearch available on all Linux distributions?**  

Yes, it is part of the SELinux toolset and is available on most distributions with SELinux enabled.  

#### **5. Can sesearch help optimize SELinux policies?**  

Yes, by analyzing existing rules, you can identify redundant or overly permissive policies.  

#### **6. What does the `--allow` flag do?**  

It filters the output to show only `allow` rules, simplifying policy analysis.
