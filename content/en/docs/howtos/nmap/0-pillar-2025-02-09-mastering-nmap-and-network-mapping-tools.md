Here's a **comprehensive roadmap** for mastering **Nmap** and network mapping tools, covering everything from beginner to advanced topics.

## **Phase 1: Introduction to Nmap and Network Scanning Basics**

### **1. Understanding Nmap and Network Mapping**

- What is Nmap?
- Why is network scanning important?
- Ethical considerations and legal aspects of network scanning.
- Installing Nmap on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
- Using Zenmap (Nmap's GUI) for visualization.

### **2. Basic Nmap Commands and Syntax**

- Nmap command structure.
- Scanning a single target vs. multiple targets.
- Using hostnames vs. IP addresses.
- Excluding specific hosts from scans (`--exclude`).

### **3. Host Discovery Techniques**

- **ICMP Echo Request Scan (`-PE`)** – Check if a host is online.
- **ICMP Timestamp Scan (`-PP`)** – Check system uptime.
- **ICMP Address Mask Scan (`-PM`)** – Detect network subnet mask.
- **TCP SYN Ping (`-PS`)** – Send SYN packets to specific ports.
- **TCP ACK Ping (`-PA`)** – Detect firewall rules.
- **UDP Ping (`-PU`)** – Send UDP packets to determine live hosts.
- **ARP Discovery (`-PR`)** – Used in local networks for host discovery.

## **Phase 2: Intermediate Scanning Techniques**

### **4. Basic and Advanced Port Scanning**

- What are ports? Understanding TCP/UDP.
- Default vs. custom port scans (`-p` option).
- Scanning multiple ports, port ranges, and excluding ports.
- Detecting open, closed, filtered, and unfiltered ports.

### **5. Common Scan Types and Their Purposes**

- **TCP Connect Scan (`-sT`)** – Full TCP connection.
- **SYN (Stealth) Scan (`-sS`)** – Half-open scan to avoid detection.
- **UDP Scan (`-sU`)** – Identifying open UDP ports.
- **NULL Scan (`-sN`)** – Evading IDS detection by sending no TCP flags.
- **FIN Scan (`-sF`)** – Sends FIN packet to bypass firewalls.
- **Xmas Tree Scan (`-sX`)** – Highly evasive scan.
- **ACK Scan (`-sA`)** – Firewall rule testing.
- **Window Scan (`-sW`)** – Identifies open ports using TCP window sizes.
- **Maimon Scan (`-sM`)** – Similar to FIN scan but less common.

### **6. Service and Version Detection**

- Basic version detection (`-sV`).
- Intense version scanning (`--version-intensity`).
- Customizing version detection with probes.

### **7. OS Detection and Fingerprinting**

- Basic OS detection (`-O`).
- Aggressive OS scanning (`-A`).
- Bypassing OS detection limitations.

## **Phase 3: Advanced Nmap Scanning Techniques**

### **8. Firewall, IDS, and Evasion Techniques**

- **Fragmentation Scans (`-f`, `--mtu`)** – Sending smaller fragmented packets.
- **Decoy Scans (`-D`)** – Hiding the real attacker's IP.
- **Spoofing Source Address (`-S`)** – Impersonating another machine.
- **Using Randomized IPs (`-iR`)** – Scanning random IPs to hide activity.
- **Using the `--badsum` option** – Sending packets with incorrect checksums.
- **Packet Timing Adjustments (`--scan-delay`)** – Slowing scans to avoid detection.

### **9. Advanced Host Enumeration**

- Identifying running services and their configurations.
- Detecting default or misconfigured services.
- Finding hidden services behind firewalls.

### **10. Timing and Performance Optimization**

- Understanding timing templates (`-T0` to `-T5`).
- Adjusting parallelism (`--min-parallelism`, `--max-parallelism`).
- Limiting packet transmission rates (`--min-rate`, `--max-rate`).

### **11. Advanced Output and Reporting**

- Normal output (`-oN`).
- Grepable output (`-oG`).
- XML output (`-oX`).
- JSON output (`-oJ`).
- Saving results for later analysis.

## **Phase 4: Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE)**

### **12. Understanding NSE and Its Capabilities**

- What is NSE?
- Where to find NSE scripts.
- How to execute scripts (`--script` option).

### **13. Using NSE Scripts for Security Testing**

- **Discovery Scripts (`discovery`)** – Finding hidden hosts and services.
- **Vulnerability Detection Scripts (`vuln`)** – Identifying known exploits.
- **Exploitation Scripts (`exploit`)** – Testing common security flaws.
- **Brute Force Scripts (`brute`)** – Testing weak authentication.
- **Malware Detection Scripts (`malware`)** – Checking for malicious services.

### **14. Writing Custom NSE Scripts**

- Basics of Lua programming.
- Writing a simple NSE script.
- Debugging and optimizing scripts.

## **Phase 5: Real-World Applications of Nmap**

### **15. Reconnaissance for Penetration Testing**

- Using Nmap for footprinting.
- Mapping an organization's attack surface.
- Identifying security weaknesses before an attack.

### **16. Vulnerability Scanning with Nmap**

- Finding open ports that expose vulnerabilities.
- Checking for outdated services and exploits.
- Automating vulnerability scanning.

### **17. Integrating Nmap with Other Security Tools**

- Using Nmap with Metasploit.
- Importing Nmap results into Nessus.
- Combining Nmap with Wireshark for deeper analysis.

### **18. Automating Nmap Scans**

- Writing Bash scripts for automation.
- Scheduling scans with `cron`.
- Setting up email alerts for scan results.

## **Phase 6: Expert-Level Nmap Techniques**

### **19. Large-Scale Network Scanning**

- Scanning entire subnets efficiently.
- Best practices for scanning large networks.
- Handling massive amounts of scan data.

### **20. IPv6 Scanning with Nmap**

- Scanning IPv6 addresses (`-6` option).
- Differences between IPv4 and IPv6 scanning.
- Identifying IPv6-only hosts.

### **21. Bypassing Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**

- Detecting IDS in a network.
- Using custom packet manipulation.
- Evading detection with slow scans.

### **22. Advanced Packet Crafting with Nmap**
