HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the foundation of web development, used to structure content on the web. Every web page you interact with is built using HTML, and at the heart of this language are **HTML tags**. These tags define everything from the layout and design of a website to the interactive elements users engage with. To make your journey through HTML easier, we’ve compiled a comprehensive guide to HTML tags, ordered alphabetically. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned developer, this guide will serve as a handy reference for understanding the function of each tag.

## 1. Introduction to HTML Tags

HTML tags are the basic building blocks of a webpage. They are enclosed in angle brackets (`< >`) and usually come in pairs: an opening tag (`<tag>`) and a closing tag (`</tag>`), with content placed between them. Some tags, known as **self-closing tags**, do not have closing counterparts. Tags are used to define different parts of a webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, forms, and more.

Each HTML tag serves a specific function, helping browsers interpret how to display the content on the page. Tags are often accompanied by **attributes**, which provide additional information about the elements they modify.

## 2. A-Z List of HTML Tags
