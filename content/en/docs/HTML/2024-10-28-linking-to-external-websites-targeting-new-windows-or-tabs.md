When linking to external websites in your content, an essential consideration is deciding whether the links should open in the same window or a new one. This choice, commonly implemented by using the `target="_blank"` attribute in HTML, can significantly affect user experience and has both pros and cons depending on the context of your content. In this post, we’ll explore how `target="_blank"` works, when to use it, its benefits and drawbacks, and some best practices to ensure an optimal user experience.
What Does `target="_blank"` Mean?

In HTML, links are typically created with the `<a>` (anchor) tag, where the `href` attribute specifies the URL destination. Adding `target="_blank"` to a link tells the browser to open the link in a new tab or window, depending on the user’s settings and browser. Here’s an example:
```bash
<a href="https://example.com" target="_blank">Visit Example.com</a>
```

When applied, this attribute opens the link in a new tab, allowing the user to view the external site without leaving the original page.
Benefits of Opening External Links in a New Tab

Using `target="_blank"` for external links offers several advantages that enhance user experience, particularly in content-focused environments.
#### 1. **Keeps Users on Your Page**

When users click on a link that opens in the same window, they navigate away from your site. This can disrupt their experience, especially if they get engrossed in the external site and forget to return. By opening external links in a new tab, you allow users to explore additional resources without losing their place on your page.
#### 2. **Preserves the Flow of Content**

Opening links in a new tab helps maintain the continuity of a user’s experience. For example, if a user is reading an article and clicks a link to an external source, opening it in a new tab allows them to reference the external content while keeping your article open. This is especially useful for educational content, tutorials, or any resource-based content.
#### 3. **Supports Reference-Heavy Content**

If your content includes numerous external citations or reference links, opening these in a new tab can be beneficial. Users can quickly refer to these sources without losing track of the main content, which is especially helpful in research-based articles, guides, and academic content.
Potential Drawbacks of `target="_blank"`

While targeting new tabs or windows has clear benefits, there are some downsides to consider, especially when it comes to user control and accessibility.
#### 1. **Takes Control Away from Users**

Some users prefer to choose when and where to open links. Forcing links to open in a new tab can be inconvenient for those who prefer to manage tabs themselves, and it can feel intrusive to users who prefer links to open in the same window.
#### 2. **Can Cause Browser Clutter**

Opening multiple links in new tabs can quickly clutter a user’s browser, especially if they are following several links on the same page. For users with limited device resources, this can lead to a slower browsing experience or confusion when trying to keep track of multiple tabs.
#### 3. **Accessibility Concerns**

For users who rely on screen readers or other accessibility tools, opening new tabs can cause confusion, as they may not be aware that a new tab has opened. This can be mitigated by adding a visual indicator, such as an icon or text, that informs users the link will open in a new tab.
Best Practices for Using `target="_blank"`

To maximize the benefits of `target="_blank"` while minimizing its potential drawbacks, consider the following best practices:
#### 1. **Use It Sparingly**

Only apply `target="_blank"` to external links that enhance the content, such as links to resources or citations. Avoid using it excessively, as too many new tabs can be overwhelming for users.
#### 2. **Provide a Visual Indicator**

Help users understand that a link will open in a new tab by adding a visual indicator, such as a small icon or a note next to the link. This gives users a choice and keeps the experience transparent.
#### 3. **Add `rel="noopener noreferrer"` for Security**

When using `target="_blank"`, add `rel="noopener noreferrer"` to the link. This attribute prevents a security vulnerability known as "tabnabbing," which can allow the new tab to gain access to the original page’s window object, creating potential risks. Here’s how it should look:
```bash
<a href="https://example.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visit Example.com</a>
```
#### 4. **Consider Context and User Preferences**

Think about your audience’s needs when deciding whether to use `target="_blank"`. For content aimed at a general audience, consider using it only when linking to websites or resources where users may want to keep the original page open.
Final Thoughts

Using `target="_blank"` for external links is a helpful tool to enhance user experience by allowing visitors to explore additional content while keeping your page open. However, it’s important to use it thoughtfully, balancing convenience with user control and security. By following best practices like using it selectively, adding visual indicators, and securing the link with `rel="noopener noreferrer"`, you can make external linking both functional and user-friendly, ensuring a seamless browsing experience for all.
