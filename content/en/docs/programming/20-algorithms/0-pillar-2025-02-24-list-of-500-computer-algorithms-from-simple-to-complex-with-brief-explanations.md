2. **Binary Search**: Divides a sorted array repeatedly in half to quickly find a target value. Much faster than a linear search for sorted data.
3. **Jump Search**: Jumps ahead by fixed steps in a sorted array, then performs a linear search in the smaller subset. A middle ground between linear and binary search.
4. **Interpolation Search**: This method improves binary search by estimating the position based on the search key value. It works best with uniformly distributed data.
5. **Exponential Search**: This method finds a range where the element might exist and then applies a binary search. It is useful for unbounded or infinite arrays.
6. **Ternary Search**: Similar to binary search but divides the array into three parts instead of two. Useful for finding extrema in unimodal functions.
7. **Fibonacci Search**: Uses Fibonacci numbers to divide the array, requiring only addition operations. Works well with arrays that can't be randomly accessed.
