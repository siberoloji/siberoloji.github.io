## Level 1: Kotlin Fundamentals (2-3 weeks)

### Week 1: Getting Started

1. Introduction to Kotlin
   - [History and purpose](/history-and-purpose-of-kotlin/)
   - [Kotlin vs Java](/kotlin-vs-java-a-comprehensive-guide-to-understanding-their-differences/)
   - [Setting up development environment](/setting-up-kotlin-development-environment/)

2. Basic Syntax
   - [Variables and data types](/variables-and-data-types-in-kotlin/)
   - [val vs var](/val-vs-var-detailed-explanation-in-kotlin-programming-language/)
   - Type inference
   - Basic operators
   - String templates

3. Control Flow
   - if/else expressions
   - when expressions
   - Loops (for, while, do-while)
   - Ranges
   - Jump expressions (break, continue, return)

### Week 2-3: Core Concepts

1. Functions
   - Function declarations
   - Parameters and return types
   - Single-expression functions
   - Default arguments
   - Named arguments
   - Extension functions

2. Collections
   - Lists, Sets, Maps
   - Mutable vs Immutable collections
   - Collection operations
   - Sequences

3. Null Safety
   - Nullable types
   - Safe calls
   - Elvis operator
   - Not-null assertions
   - Smart casts

## Level 2: Object-Oriented Programming (3-4 weeks)

### Week 4-5: Classes and Objects

1. Classes and Properties
   - Class declaration
   - Primary and secondary constructors
   - Properties and backing fields
   - Getters and setters
   - Late-initialized properties

2. Inheritance and Interfaces
   - Open classes

   - Sealed classes
   - Enum classes
   - Object declarations
   - Companion objects

### Week 6-7: Advanced OOP

1. Generics
   - Generic classes

   - Type projections
   - Variance (in/out)
   - Reified type parameters

2. Delegation
   - Class delegation
   - Property delegation
   - Observable properties
