In the realm of cybersecurity, particularly in penetration testing and ethical hacking, tools that facilitate the analysis and exploitation of Active Directory (AD) environments are invaluable. One such tool that has garnered attention is **BloodyAD**, an Active Directory Privilege Escalation Framework integrated into the Kali Linux distribution. This article aims to provide an in-depth look at BloodyAD, exploring its features, installation process, usage, and practical applications.

## **Understanding BloodyAD**

**BloodyAD** is an open-source framework designed to identify and exploit privilege escalation paths within Active Directory environments. It operates by performing specific LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) and SAMR (Security Account Manager Remote) calls to a domain controller, enabling users to manipulate AD objects and configurations to achieve elevated privileges. This tool supports various authentication methods, including:

- **Cleartext Passwords**: Direct authentication using plain text credentials.
- **Pass-the-Hash**: Utilizing NTLM hashes to authenticate without knowing the actual password.
- **Pass-the-Ticket**: Employing Kerberos tickets for authentication.
- **Certificates**: Using digital certificates for secure authentication.

BloodyAD is designed to bind to LDAP services of a domain controller to perform privilege escalation tasks. Notably, it supports the exchange of sensitive information without requiring LDAPS (LDAP over SSL/TLS), enhancing its flexibility in different network configurations. Additionally, it is designed to be used transparently with a SOCKS proxy, facilitating operations in segmented networks. ([GitHub](https://github.com/CravateRouge/bloodyAD?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

## **Using BloodyAD: A Practical Overview**

Once installed, BloodyAD can be utilized to perform various tasks within an Active Directory environment. Below is an overview of common commands and their usage:

### **1. Changing a User's Password**

To change the password of a user account:

```bash
bloodyAD --host <DC_IP> -d <domain> -u <username> -p <password> changePassword <target_user> '<new_password>'
```

**Example**:

```bash
bloodyAD --host 192.168.1.10 -d example.local -u admin -p 'AdminPass123' changePassword john.doe 'NewPass123!'
```

This command changes the password of `john.doe` to `NewPass123!`. ([GitHub](https://github.com/CravateRouge/bloodyAD/wiki/User-Guide?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

### **2. Adding a New User**

To add a new user to the domain:

```bash
bloodyAD --host <DC_IP> -d <domain> -u <username> -p <password> addUser <new_user> '<new_user_password>'
```

**Example**:

```bash
bloodyAD --host 192.168.1.10 -d example.local -u admin -p 'AdminPass123' addUser jane.doe 'SecurePass456!'
```

This command creates a new user `jane.doe` with the password `SecurePass456!`. ([GitHub](https://github.com/CravateRouge/bloodyAD/wiki/User-Guide?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

### **3. Setting User Account Control (UAC) Flags**

To modify User Account Control flags for a user:

```bash
bloodyAD --host <DC_IP> -d <domain> -u <username> -p <password> setUserAccountControl <target_user> <UAC_flag> <True/False>
```

**Example**:

```bash
bloodyAD --host 192.168.1.10 -d example.local -u admin -p 'AdminPass123' setUserAccountControl john.doe 0x400000 True
```

This command enables the `DONT_REQ_PREAUTH` flag for `john.doe`, making the account susceptible to ASREPRoasting attacks. ([GitHub](https://github.com/CravateRouge/bloodyAD/wiki/User-Guide?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

### **4. Retrieving Group Members**

To list members of a specific group:

```bash
bloodyAD --host <DC_IP> -d <domain> -u <username> -p <password> getObjectAttributes <group_dn> member
```

**Example**:

```bash
bloodyAD --host 192.168.1.10 -d example.local -u admin -p 'AdminPass123' getObjectAttributes 'CN=Admins,CN=Users,DC=example,DC=local' member
```

This command lists all members of the `Admins` group. ([GitHub](https://github.com/CravateRouge/bloodyAD/wiki/User-Guide?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

### **5. Adding a User to a Group**

To add a user to a specific group:

```bash
bloodyAD --host <DC_IP> -d <domain> -u <username> -p <password> addObjectToGroup <target_user> <target_group>
```

**Example**:

```bash
bloodyAD --host 192.168.1.10 -d example.local -u admin -p 'AdminPass123' addObjectToGroup jane.doe 'CN=Admins,CN=Users,DC=example,DC=local'
```

This command adds `jane.doe` to the `Admins` group. ([GitHub](https://github.com/CravateRouge/bloodyAD/wiki/User-Guide?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
