First, it's always a good idea to update your system to ensure that you have the latest packages and security patches. Open a terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```

### Step 2: Install Java Runtime Environment (JRE)

Bytecode Viewer is a Java-based application, so you'll need to have Java installed on your system. Kali Linux typically comes with Java pre-installed, but if it's not, you can install it using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install default-jre
```

To verify that Java is installed correctly, you can check the version:

```bash
java -version
```

You should see output similar to:

```bash
openjdk version "11.0.11" 2021-04-20
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 11.0.11+9-post-Debian-1)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 11.0.11+9-post-Debian-1, mixed mode, sharing)
```

### Step 3: Download Bytecode Viewer

Next, you'll need to download Bytecode Viewer. You can get the latest version from the official GitHub repository:

```bash
wget https://github.com/Konloch/bytecode-viewer/releases/download/v2.10.4/Bytecode-Viewer-2.10.4.jar
```

This command downloads the Bytecode Viewer JAR file to your current directory.

### Step 4: Run Bytecode Viewer

Once the download is complete, you can run Bytecode Viewer using the following command:

```bash
java -jar Bytecode-Viewer-2.10.4.jar
```

This will launch the Bytecode Viewer GUI, and you're ready to start analyzing Java bytecode.

## Using Bytecode Viewer: A Step-by-Step Guide

Now that Bytecode Viewer is installed and running, let's explore how to use it effectively. We'll walk through the process of loading a Java JAR file, decompiling it, and analyzing the bytecode.

### Step 1: Loading a JAR File

1. **Open Bytecode Viewer**: If it's not already open, launch Bytecode Viewer using the command mentioned earlier.

2. **Load a JAR File**: Click on the "Open" button in the top-left corner of the Bytecode Viewer interface. Navigate to the location of the JAR file you want to analyze and select it. Bytecode Viewer will load the JAR file and display its contents in the left-hand pane.

### Step 2: Decompiling the Bytecode

Bytecode Viewer supports multiple decompilers, and you can choose which one to use based on your preference or the specific requirements of your analysis.

1. **Select a Decompiler**: In the top-right corner of the Bytecode Viewer interface, you'll see a dropdown menu labeled "Decompiler." Click on it and select one of the available decompilers (e.g., JD-GUI, Procyon, CFR, FernFlower).

2. **View Decompiled Code**: Once you've selected a decompiler, Bytecode Viewer will automatically decompile the selected class file and display the Java source code in the main pane. You can navigate through the different classes and methods using the tree structure on the left.
