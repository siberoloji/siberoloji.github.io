## **How Bully Works**

Bully uses a brute-force attack to crack the WPS PIN of a target wireless network. Once the WPS PIN is discovered, it can be used to retrieve the Wi-Fi password (PSK).  

### **Steps in the Process**  

1. **Target Identification**  
   Identify WPS-enabled access points in range using a Wi-Fi scanning tool such as `airodump-ng`.  

2. **PIN Brute-Forcing**  
   Bully systematically attempts different PIN combinations until the correct one is discovered.  

3. **Error Handling**  
   If the access point locks or becomes unresponsive, Bully handles retries intelligently, reducing downtime.  

4. **Retrieve Network Password**  
   Once the WPS PIN is cracked, the tool retrieves the Wi-Fi password, granting access to the network.

## **Using Bully: A Step-by-Step Guide**

Below is a detailed guide on using Bully for penetration testing:  

### **Step 1: Prepare Your Environment**  

Ensure you have the necessary hardware:  

- A Wi-Fi adapter that supports monitor mode and packet injection.  
- A Kali Linux installation.  

### **Step 2: Enable Monitor Mode**  

Put your Wi-Fi adapter into monitor mode using `airmon-ng`:  

```bash
sudo airmon-ng start wlan0
```

Replace `wlan0` with the name of your Wi-Fi interface.  

### **Step 3: Identify WPS-Enabled Access Points**  

Use `airodump-ng` to scan for WPS-enabled networks:  

```bash
sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon
```

Look for access points where WPS is enabled. Note the BSSID and channel of your target network.  

### **Step 4: Start Bully**  

Run Bully with the target’s BSSID and channel:  

```bash
sudo bully wlan0mon -b <BSSID> -c <channel>
```

Replace `<BSSID>` with the MAC address of the target access point and `<channel>` with its operating channel.  

### **Step 5: Monitor the Process**  

Bully will begin brute-forcing the WPS PIN. The tool provides real-time feedback, showing progress and any errors encountered.  

### **Step 6: Retrieve the Wi-Fi Password**  

Once the correct PIN is discovered, Bully will display the WPS PIN and the network password.  

### **Step 7: Disable Monitor Mode**  

After completing the attack, return your Wi-Fi adapter to its normal state:  

```bash
sudo airmon-ng stop wlan0mon
```
