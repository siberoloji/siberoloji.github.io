## Introduction

Security professionals and penetration testers often encounter systems and devices with default credentials left unchanged. The **Changeme** tool, included in Kali Linux, is designed to automate the detection of these default credentials across multiple services and devices. Identifying and mitigating these risks is crucial to preventing unauthorized access and potential exploitation.

In this detailed guide, we'll explore **Changeme** in Kali Linux, covering its installation, functionality, use cases, and best practices for security professionals.

## What is Changeme?

Changeme is an open-source security tool that scans for **default and weak credentials** on networked devices and services. It is particularly useful for penetration testers and security auditors who need to check for vulnerabilities arising from unchanged factory passwords.

Many networked systems ship with default credentials, and administrators sometimes overlook changing them. This tool automates the process of checking for these weak points, saving time and effort while improving security assessments.

### Key Features of Changeme

- **Automated default credential scanning**
- **Supports multiple protocols** (HTTP, FTP, SSH, Telnet, SNMP, MySQL, MSSQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)
- **Customizable credential dictionaries**
- **Fast scanning and reporting capabilities**
- **Integration with penetration testing workflows**

## Installing Changeme on Kali Linux

Changeme is pre-installed in Kali Linux, but if you need to install or update it manually, follow these steps:

### 1. Check if Changeme is Installed

```bash
changeme --help
```

If it is installed, this command will display the available options.

### 2. Installing or Updating Changeme

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ztgrace/changeme.git
cd changeme
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

This clones the latest version from GitHub and installs any dependencies required for execution.

## How to Use Changeme

### 1. Basic Usage

To run a simple scan against a target using Changeme, use the following command:

```bash
changeme -t <target-ip>
```

This command scans the specified target and attempts to authenticate using a list of known default credentials.

### 2. Scanning a Range of IPs

If you want to check multiple devices on a network, you can specify a range:

```bash
changeme -t 192.168.1.0/24
```

This will scan all devices within the 192.168.1.x subnet.

### 3. Specifying a Service

To scan a specific service such as FTP, SSH, or HTTP, use the `-s` flag:

```bash
changeme -t 192.168.1.100 -s ssh
```

This will attempt to authenticate to the SSH service using known default credentials.

### 4. Using a Custom Credential List

Changeme allows you to specify your own set of credentials to test against a system:

```bash
changeme -t 192.168.1.100 -c /path/to/custom-credentials.txt
```

This is particularly useful for testing non-standard devices with unique default passwords.

### 5. Output and Logging

To save the results of a scan for further analysis:

```bash
changeme -t 192.168.1.100 -o results.txt
```

This writes the findings to a text file, which can be useful for generating security reports.

## Real-World Use Cases for Changeme

### 1. Penetration Testing

Changeme helps penetration testers quickly identify weak points in network security by checking for devices with unchanged default credentials. This is a critical step in the **reconnaissance and initial access** phases of penetration testing.

### 2. Internal Security Audits

Organizations can use Changeme to perform internal security audits and ensure that networked devices are not vulnerable due to default credentials.

### 3. Compliance Testing

Regulatory frameworks such as **ISO 27001, NIST, and GDPR** require organizations to follow best security practices, including changing default passwords. Changeme can be used to verify compliance with these standards.

### 4. IoT and Industrial Control Systems (ICS) Security

Many **IoT devices and ICS components** come with factory-set passwords. Changeme helps identify these weak points to prevent potential cyberattacks.

---

## Limitations and Considerations

### 1. **Does Not Crack Passwords**

Changeme only checks for known default passwords; it does not attempt brute-force attacks or password cracking.

### 2. **False Positives**

Some services may be configured differently, leading to potential false positives in reports. It's important to manually verify findings.

### 3. **Legal and Ethical Use**

Using Changeme against systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test is illegal and unethical. Always obtain proper authorization before conducting security assessments.

## Best Practices for Using Changeme

- **Run scans regularly**: Periodic checks ensure that no devices have default credentials left unchanged.
- **Customize credential lists**: Updating credential dictionaries ensures better detection for specific environments.
- **Combine with other tools**: Use Changeme alongside **Nmap, Hydra, and Metasploit** for a more comprehensive security assessment.
- **Follow responsible disclosure**: If you discover vulnerable devices, report them to the appropriate teams for remediation.

---

## Conclusion

Changeme is a powerful yet simple tool in the **Kali Linux** arsenal, making it easy to detect default credentials across multiple protocols and services. By leveraging its automation and extensive credential databases, penetration testers and security professionals can quickly identify and remediate security risks.

In an era where **cyber threats** are ever-growing, ensuring that default passwords are changed is a fundamental but critical step in **network security.** Whether you're conducting an internal audit, performing penetration testing, or ensuring compliance, **Changeme is a must-have tool in your security toolkit.**
