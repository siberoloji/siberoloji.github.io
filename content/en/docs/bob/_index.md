**Meet Bob, the Linux Guy**
<img src="/images/bobs-adventures-with-alma-linux.png" width="400" height="200"> 

Bob is a freshly minted Junior System Administrator, and like many new sysadmins, he’s both excited and a little overwhelmed by his new responsibilities. As he digs into his role, he quickly learns that mastering Linux is at the core of becoming a true pro. There’s just one small hitch—Linux is massive, and choosing where to start feels like staring into an endless sea of terminal commands and system quirks.

But Bob is determined! After some research, he’s decided to dive into Linux. However, as a beginner, Bob knows he has a steep learning curve ahead.
