Bob realized that while he could perform many tasks manually, scripting would allow him to automate repetitive jobs, reduce errors, and save time. It was time to move beyond the basics of bash scripting and explore advanced techniques.

> *“With great scripts comes great power!”* Bob said, excited to unlock the full potential of bash.

### **Part 1: Introduction: Why Bash Scripting?**

Bob understood that bash scripting is the glue that holds system administration tasks together. From automating backups to monitoring servers, scripts are indispensable tools for any sysadmin.

#### **Recap of Bash Basics**

- Writing a script:

  ```bash
  #!/bin/bash
  echo "Hello, AlmaLinux!"
  ```

- Making it executable:

  ```bash
  chmod +x myscript.sh
  ```

> *“Time to level up and make my scripts smarter!”* Bob said.

---

### **Part 2: Using Functions in Scripts**

Functions help Bob organize his scripts into reusable chunks of code.

#### **Step 1: Defining and Calling Functions**

Bob created a simple function to check if a service was running:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

check_service() {
    if systemctl is-active --quiet $1; then
        echo "$1 is running."
    else
        echo "$1 is not running."
    fi
}

check_service httpd
```

#### **Step 2: Passing Arguments to Functions**

Functions can accept arguments:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

greet_user() {
    echo "Hello, $1! Welcome to $2."
}

greet_user "Bob" "AlmaLinux"
```

> *“Functions make my scripts modular and readable!”* Bob noted.

---

### **Part 3: Working with Arrays**

Bob learned to use arrays to store and process multiple values.

#### **Step 1: Declaring and Accessing Arrays**

- Declare an array:

  ```bash
  services=("httpd" "sshd" "firewalld")
  ```

- Access elements:

  ```bash
  echo ${services[0]}  # Outputs: httpd
  ```

#### **Step 2: Looping Through Arrays**

Bob wrote a script to check the status of multiple services:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

services=("httpd" "sshd" "firewalld")

for service in "${services[@]}"; do
    systemctl is-active --quiet $service && echo "$service is running." || echo "$service is not running."
done
```

> *“Arrays are perfect for handling lists of items!”* Bob said.

---

### **Part 4: Error Handling and Debugging**

Bob added error handling to his scripts to catch failures gracefully.

#### **Step 1: Checking Command Success**

The `$?` variable stores the exit status of the last command:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

mkdir /tmp/testdir
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Directory created successfully."
else
    echo "Failed to create directory."
fi
```

#### **Step 2: Debugging with `set -x`**

Bob used `set -x` to debug his scripts:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -x
echo "Debugging this script."
mkdir /tmp/testdir
set +x
```

> *“With error handling and debugging, my scripts are rock solid!”* Bob said.

---

### **Part 5: Advanced Input and Output**

Bob explored advanced ways to handle input and output in his scripts.

#### **Step 1: Redirecting Output**

- Redirect standard output:

  ```bash
  ls > filelist.txt
  ```

- Redirect standard error:

  ```bash
  ls /nonexistent 2> error.log
  ```

#### **Step 2: Using `read` for Interactive Scripts**

Bob wrote a script to prompt for user input:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

read -p "Enter your name: " name
echo "Hello, $name!"
```

> *“Interactive scripts make user input seamless!”* Bob said.

---

### **Part 6: Text Processing with `awk` and `sed`**

Bob enhanced his scripts with powerful text-processing tools.

#### **Step 1: Using `awk`**

Bob used `awk` to extract specific columns from a file:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo -e "Name Age Bob 30 Alice 25" > users.txt
awk '{print $1}' users.txt  # Outputs: Name, Bob, Alice
```

#### **Step 2: Editing Files with `sed`**

Bob used `sed` to perform in-place edits:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Hello World" > message.txt
sed -i 's/World/Bob/' message.txt
```

> *“With `awk` and `sed`, I can transform data like a pro!”* Bob said.

---

### **Part 7: Creating Cron-Compatible Scripts**

Bob learned to write scripts that run reliably as cron jobs.

#### **Step 1: Writing a Cron-Compatible Script**

Bob created a script to back up logs:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

tar -czf /backup/logs-$(date +%F).tar.gz /var/log
```

- Add it to the crontab:

  ```bash
  crontab -e
  ```

  Add the following line to run the script daily at midnight:

  ```plaintext
  0 0 * * * /home/bob/backup_logs.sh
  ```

#### **Step 2: Testing Cron Jobs**

Bob tested the script manually to ensure it worked:

```bash
bash /home/bob/backup_logs.sh
```

> *“Automation for the win—cron jobs save me so much time!”* Bob said.

### **Conclusion: Bob Reflects on Scripting Mastery**

Bob now had the skills to write advanced bash scripts that were modular, reliable, and powerful. Armed with these tools, he felt ready to tackle any system administration challenge.
