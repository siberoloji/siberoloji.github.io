## Motivation

Bob is determined! After some research, he’s decided to dive into AlmaLinux, a robust, community-driven distribution compatible with Red Hat but completely free and open-source. He’s read that AlmaLinux is popular in enterprise environments for its stability and security, which are crucial in his line of work. However, Bob knows he has a steep learning curve ahead as a beginner.

Bob’s First Challenge: Installing AlmaLinux. It should be simple, right? He rolls up his sleeves and gets ready for his first adventure.
