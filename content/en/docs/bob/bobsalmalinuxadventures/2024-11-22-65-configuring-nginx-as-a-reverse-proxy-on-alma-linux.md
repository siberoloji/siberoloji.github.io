Bob’s manager was impressed with his Apache setup but tasked him with learning **Nginx** to use as a **reverse proxy**. This would allow Bob to offload tasks like caching, load balancing, and SSL termination, while Apache handled the backend web serving.

> *“Nginx as a reverse proxy? Sounds fancy—let’s make it happen!”* Bob said, eager to expand his web server skills.

### **Part 1: Introduction: What Is a Reverse Proxy?**

Bob discovered that a reverse proxy is an intermediary server that forwards client requests to backend servers. It’s commonly used for:

- **Load Balancing**: Distributing traffic across multiple servers.
- **SSL Termination**: Handling HTTPS connections for backend servers.
- **Caching**: Reducing the load on backend servers by storing frequently accessed content.

> *“Nginx’s efficiency and versatility make it a perfect reverse proxy!”* Bob thought as he started installing it.

---

### **Part 2: Installing Nginx on AlmaLinux**

#### **Step 1: Installing Nginx**

- Bob installed Nginx using `dnf`:

  ```bash
  sudo dnf install -y nginx
  ```

#### **Step 2: Enabling and Starting Nginx**

- Enable and start the Nginx service:

  ```bash
  sudo systemctl enable nginx --now
  ```

- Check the status of the service:

  ```bash
  sudo systemctl status nginx
  ```

  If running successfully, Bob would see:

  ```bash
  ● nginx.service - The nginx HTTP and reverse proxy server
       Active: active (running)
  ```

#### **Step 3: Testing Nginx**

Bob opened a browser and navigated to the server’s IP address (`http://<server-ip>`). He saw the default Nginx welcome page, confirming the installation was successful.

> *“Nginx is live! Time to configure it as a reverse proxy,”* Bob said, ready for the next step.

---

### **Part 3: Configuring Nginx as a Reverse Proxy**

#### **Step 1: Setting Up a Basic Reverse Proxy**

Bob configured Nginx to forward requests to an Apache backend server running on the same machine (or a different server).

- Edit the default Nginx configuration file:

  ```bash
  sudo nano /etc/nginx/conf.d/reverse-proxy.conf
  ```

- Add the following configuration:

  ```plaintext
  server {
      listen 80;

      server_name yourdomain.com;

      location / {
          proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080;  # Backend Apache server
          proxy_set_header Host $host;
          proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
          proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
      }
  }
  ```

- Save the file and restart Nginx:

  ```bash
  sudo systemctl restart nginx
  ```

- Test the configuration:

  ```bash
  sudo nginx -t
  ```

Bob verified that requests to Nginx (`http://yourdomain.com`) were forwarded to Apache running on port 8080.

---

#### **Step 2: Load Balancing with Nginx**

Bob expanded the setup to balance traffic across multiple backend servers.

- Update the reverse proxy configuration:

  ```plaintext
  upstream backend {
      server 192.168.1.10;
      server 192.168.1.11;
  }

  server {
      listen 80;

      server_name yourdomain.com;

      location / {
          proxy_pass http://backend;
          proxy_set_header Host $host;
          proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
          proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
      }
  }
  ```

- Restart Nginx to apply the changes:

  ```bash
  sudo systemctl restart nginx
  ```

Now, Bob’s Nginx server distributed traffic evenly between the two backend servers.

> *“Load balancing for high availability—this is impressive!”* Bob said.

---

### **Part 4: Enabling SSL Termination**

Bob knew HTTPS was essential for securing web traffic, so he set up SSL termination in Nginx.

#### **Step 1: Installing Certbot for Let’s Encrypt**

- Install Certbot and the Nginx plugin:

  ```bash
  sudo dnf install -y certbot python3-certbot-nginx
  ```

#### **Step 2: Obtaining an SSL Certificate**

- Run Certbot to generate and configure the certificate:

  ```bash
  sudo certbot --nginx -d yourdomain.com
  ```

Certbot automatically updated the Nginx configuration to enable HTTPS.

#### **Step 3: Redirecting HTTP to HTTPS**

Bob added a redirect rule to ensure all traffic used HTTPS:

- Update the server block in `/etc/nginx/conf.d/reverse-proxy.conf`:

  ```plaintext
  server {
      listen 80;
      server_name yourdomain.com;
      return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
  }
  ```

- Restart Nginx:

  ```bash
  sudo systemctl restart nginx
  ```

> *“HTTPS is now enabled—security first!”* Bob said, feeling accomplished.

### **Part 5: Optimizing Nginx for Performance**

#### **Enable Caching for Faster Responses**

Bob enabled caching to reduce backend load.

- Add caching directives to the Nginx configuration:

  ```plaintext
  location / {
      proxy_cache_path /var/cache/nginx levels=1:2 keys_zone=my_cache:10m inactive=60m;
      proxy_cache my_cache;
      proxy_pass http://backend;
  }
  ```

- Restart Nginx:

  ```bash
  sudo systemctl restart nginx
  ```

#### **Enable Gzip Compression**

Bob enabled Gzip compression to reduce response size.

- Add the following lines to the `http` block in `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`:

  ```plaintext
  gzip on;
  gzip_types text/plain text/css application/json application/javascript text/xml application/xml application/xml+rss text/javascript;
  ```

- Restart Nginx:

  ```bash
  sudo systemctl restart nginx
  ```

> *“With caching and compression, my Nginx server is blazing fast!”* Bob said, impressed by the results.

---

### **Part 6: Troubleshooting Common Issues**

Bob encountered some challenges but resolved them quickly:

1. **Nginx won’t start**:
   - Check for syntax errors:

     ```bash
     sudo nginx -t
     ```

2. **SSL not working**:
   - Verify the Certbot logs:

     ```bash
     sudo cat /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log
     ```

3. **Backend not reachable**:
   - Confirm that the Apache server is running and accessible.

---

### **Conclusion: Bob Reflects on His Nginx Setup**

With Nginx configured as a reverse proxy, Bob successfully handled load balancing, SSL termination, and caching. He felt confident that he could now manage scalable, secure web services.

> Next, Bob planned to explore **Firewalld for Network Security** on AlmaLinux.
