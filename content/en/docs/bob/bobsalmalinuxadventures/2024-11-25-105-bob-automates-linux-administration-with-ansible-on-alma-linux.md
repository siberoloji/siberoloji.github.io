### **Part 1: Why Use Ansible for Automation?**

Bob learned that **Ansible** is an agentless automation tool that uses SSH to manage remote systems. Its human-readable YAML syntax makes it accessible for beginners while remaining powerful for advanced tasks.

#### **Key Benefits of Ansible**

- Simplifies repetitive tasks like updates and deployments.
- Ensures consistency across systems.
- Scales easily to manage hundreds of nodes.

> *“Ansible makes automation simple and scalable—perfect for my systems!”* Bob said.

---

### **Part 2: Setting Up Ansible on AlmaLinux**

#### **Step 1: Installing Ansible**

- Install Ansible from the EPEL repository:

  ```bash
  sudo dnf install -y epel-release
  sudo dnf install -y ansible
  ```

- Verify the installation:

  ```bash
  ansible --version
  ```

#### **Step 2: Setting Up an Inventory**

- Create an inventory file:

  ```bash
  nano /etc/ansible/hosts
  ```

  Add:

  ```plaintext
  [webservers]
  web1 ansible_host=192.168.1.101
  web2 ansible_host=192.168.1.102

  [databases]
  db1 ansible_host=192.168.1.201
  ```

- Test connectivity:

  ```bash
  ansible all -m ping
  ```

> *“Ansible is now ready to manage my systems!”* Bob said.

---

### **Part 3: Running Basic Ansible Commands**

#### **Step 1: Executing Ad-Hoc Tasks**

- Check uptime on all nodes:

  ```bash
  ansible all -a "uptime"
  ```

- Restart a service:

  ```bash
  ansible webservers -b -m service -a "name=httpd state=restarted"
  ```

#### **Step 2: Using Ansible Modules**

- Create a directory:

  ```bash
  ansible webservers -m file -a "path=/var/www/html/myapp state=directory"
  ```

- Copy a file:

  ```bash
  ansible databases -m copy -a "src=/etc/my.cnf dest=/etc/my.cnf.backup"
  ```

> *“Ad-hoc commands handle quick fixes across my network!”* Bob noted.

### **Part 4: Creating and Using Ansible Playbooks**

#### **Step 1: Writing a YAML Playbook**

- Create a playbook for deploying a web application:

  ```yaml
  ---
  - name: Deploy Web Application
    hosts: webservers
    become: yes
    tasks:
      - name: Install Apache
        yum:
          name: httpd
          state: present

      - name: Start Apache
        service:
          name: httpd
          state: started

      - name: Deploy Website
        copy:
          src: /home/bob/mywebsite/index.html
          dest: /var/www/html/index.html
  ```

- Save the file as `deploy.yml`.

#### **Step 2: Running the Playbook**

- Execute the playbook:

  ```bash
  ansible-playbook deploy.yml
  ```

> *“Playbooks automate complex workflows in just a few lines of code!”* Bob said.

---

### **Part 5: Managing Complex Deployments**

#### **Step 1: Organizing Roles and Variables**

- Create a role structure:

  ```bash
  ansible-galaxy init webserver
  ```

- Define variables in `roles/webserver/vars/main.yml`:

  ```yaml
  http_port: 80
  ```

- Use the variable in a task:

  ```yaml
  - name: Configure Apache
    template:
      src: httpd.conf.j2
      dest: /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
  ```

#### **Step 2: Using Ansible Galaxy**

- Install a community role:

  ```bash
  ansible-galaxy install geerlingguy.mysql
  ```

- Use the role in a playbook:

  ```yaml
  - name: Install MySQL
    hosts: databases
    roles:
      - geerlingguy.mysql
  ```

> *“Roles make large deployments modular and reusable!”* Bob said.

### **Part 6: Securing Ansible Automation**

#### **Step 1: Managing Secrets with Ansible Vault**

- Create a vaulted file:

  ```bash
  ansible-vault create secrets.yml
  ```

- Encrypt variables:

  ```yaml
  db_password: my_secure_password
  ```

- Use the vaulted file in a playbook:

  ```bash
  ansible-playbook --ask-vault-pass deploy.yml
  ```

#### **Step 2: Securing Communication**

- Use SSH keys for Ansible:

  ```bash
  ssh-keygen -t rsa
  ssh-copy-id user@managed-node
  ```

> *“Ansible Vault and SSH ensure secure automation workflows!”* Bob noted.

### **Conclusion: Bob Reflects on Automation Mastery**

Bob successfully automated Linux administration with Ansible, handling tasks like system updates, application deployment, and configuration management. By creating secure, reusable playbooks, he saved time and improved consistency across his systems.

> Next, Bob plans to explore **Advanced Shell Scripting in AlmaLinux**, diving deeper into scripting for powerful automation.
