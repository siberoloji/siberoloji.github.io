Digital artists today have more tools at their disposal than ever before, but finding professional-grade software that's both powerful and accessible can be challenging. Enter Krita, a robust open-source digital painting program that has been quietly revolutionizing the digital art landscape since its inception in 1999.



## What Is Krita?



<a href="https://krita.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">Krita</a> is a professional-grade digital painting program that offers artists a comprehensive suite of tools for creating digital artwork. Developed by the KDE community, Krita stands out in the crowded field of digital art software for several compelling reasons: it's free, open-source, and built by artists, for artists.



The software's name comes from the Swedish word "krita" (meaning chalk or crayon) and reflects its primary focus on digital painting and illustration, though its capabilities extend far beyond these basics.
