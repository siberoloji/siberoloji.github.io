Kotlin is a modern programming language released by JetBrains in 2011. Kotlin 1.0, released on February 15, 2016, is considered the first stable version. Kotlin, which aims to provide solutions to some of the difficulties of the Java programming language and provide easier writing opportunities, can use all Java libraries retroactively.

Kotlin has a multi-platform supported structure and you can share your codes for Android, iOS and Web. You can also develop server applications.

Kotlin has the Apache 2.0 Open Source license and its codes are published on <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin" data-type="link" data-id="https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin">github</a>. At the Google I/O conference held in 2019, it was recommended and supported that software developers for Android primarily use Kotlin software.

Kotlin, which has become widespread thanks to its clear and understandable code structure as well as its code control structure that prevents errors from occurring, is recommended and supported by Google. Applications such as Maps, Home, Play, Drive and Messages that we currently use on Android phones are written using Kotlin.
