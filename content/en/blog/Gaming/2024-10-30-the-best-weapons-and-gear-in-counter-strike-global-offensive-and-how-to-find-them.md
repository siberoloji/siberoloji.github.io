Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) features an extensive arsenal of weapons and equipment, each serving specific roles in different situations. Understanding which weapons to choose and how to acquire them efficiently can significantly impact your success in the game. This comprehensive guide will help you navigate the world of CS:GO weaponry and equipment.



## Economic Fundamentals



Before diving into specific weapons, it's crucial to understand CS:GO's economic system:


* Round win reward: $3,250 (Terrorists), $3,250 (Counter-Terrorists)

* Round loss bonus: $1,400 - $3,400 (increases with consecutive losses)

* Kill rewards vary by weapon ($300 for most rifles, $600 for SMGs)

* Starting money: $800 (competitive matches)




## Primary Weapons



Rifles


#### AK-47 (Terrorist Side) - $2,700



The AK-47 stands as one of the most iconic weapons in CS:GO:


* One-shot headshot kill at any range

* High damage output (36 base damage)

* Moderate recoil pattern

* Excellent cost-effectiveness

* Best used in medium to long-range engagements




**When to Buy**: During full-buy rounds when your team has sufficient economy ($4,000+)


#### M4A4/M4A1-S (Counter-Terrorist Side) - $3,100/$2,900



These rifles serve as the Counter-Terrorist counterpart to the AK-47:


* Excellent accuracy

* More controllable recoil than AK-47

* Requires two headshots for kill (except at very close range)

* M4A1-S offers stealth advantage but limited ammo




**When to Buy**: During full-buy rounds with adequate utility money remaining



AWP (Both Sides) - $4,750



The most powerful sniper rifle in the game:


* One-shot kill to most body parts

* Extremely accurate when standing still

* High-risk, high reward

* Significant movement penalty

* Limited effectiveness in close-quarters




**When to Buy**: When team economy allows for full utility alongside the purchase



SMGs


#### MP9/MAC-10 - $1,250/$1,050



Excellent second-round or force-buy weapons:


* High movement speed

* Good accuracy while moving

* Higher kill reward ($600)

* Effective at close to medium range




**When to Buy**: Anti-eco rounds or force-buy situations



## Secondary Weapons (Pistols)



Desert Eagle - $700



The most powerful pistol in CS:GO:


* One-shot headshot potential

* High skill ceiling

* Excellent for eco rounds

* Viable against armored opponents




**When to Buy**: Eco rounds or as a sidearm for AWPers



USP-S/P2000 (CT) and Glock (T) - Default Pistols



Starting pistols with distinct characteristics:


* USP-S: Accurate, silenced, lower capacity

* P2000: Higher capacity, no silencer

* Glock: Larger magazine, lower damage, burst-fire mode




## Essential Equipment



Utility Items


#### Smoke Grenade - $300



Perhaps the most crucial utility item:


* Blocks vision for 18 seconds

* Essential for executing strategies

* Can be used defensively or offensively

* Crucial for site takes and retakes




**Usage Tips**:


* Learn lineup positions for key locations

* Use to isolate angles when taking sites

* Coordinate with the team for maximum effectiveness



#### Flashbang - $200



Tactical support grenade with multiple uses:


* Temporarily blinds opponents

* Can be thrown overhand or underhand

* Pop-flashes require practice but are highly effective




**Maximum Carry**: 2 flashbangs per player


#### HE Grenade - $300



Versatile damage-dealing grenade:


* Useful for softening opponents

* Can finish low-health enemies

* Effective for clearing common positions



#### Molotov/Incendiary Grenade - $400/$600



Area denial tool with strategic importance:


* Forces opponents out of positions

* Delays pushes and rotations

* Useful for post-plant situations




Armor


#### Kevlar Vest - $650



Essential protection in most rounds:


* Reduces damage from most weapons

* Prevents aim punch when hit

* Critical for pistol rounds



#### Kevlar + Helmet - $1,000 ($350 upgrade)



Full protection against headshots:


* Essential against most weapons

* Can be skipped against AK-47/AWP

* Critical for anti-eco rounds




## How to Build Your Loadout



Full Buy Setup ($4,700 - $5,500)



Typical full loadout includes:


* Primary weapon (Rifle/AWP)

* Armor + Helmet

* Full utility (Smoke, 2x Flash, HE, Molotov/Incendiary)

* Defuse kit (CT side)




Force Buy Setup ($2,000 - $3,000)



When the economy is limited:


* SMG or cheaper rifle

* Armor (possibly without helmet)

* Limited utility (Smoke + Flash)




Eco Round Setup ($0 - $800)



Saving money for future rounds:


* Default pistol or P250

* Minimal or no utility

* No armor




## Finding and Trading Weapon Skins



Steam Community Market



The primary marketplace for CS:GO items:


* A wide variety of skins is available

* Market prices fluctuate based on demand

* Transaction fees apply

* Seven-day trade hold on purchases




Trading Websites



Third-party trading platforms:


* Often offer better deals than Steam Market

* Require careful verification of legitimacy

* Use only well-known, reputable sites

* Always enable two-factor authentication




Trading Tips


* Research prices before trading

* Be wary of scam attempts

* Document all significant trades

* Check wear values and patterns




## Conclusion



Mastering CS:GO's weapon economy and understanding when to buy specific weapons and equipment is crucial for competitive success. Remember:


* Learn the economic fundamentals

* Practice with different weapons to find your style

* Coordinate purchases with your team

* Always consider utility alongside weapons

* Stay informed about game updates and changes




The key to success lies not just in choosing the right weapons, but in knowing when and how to use them effectively. Regular practice, especially in deathmatch and workshop maps, will help you master the weapons that best suit your playstyle.



Remember that while skins can make your weapons look appealing, they don't affect gameplay. Focus on mastering the base weapons first, and consider cosmetic enhancements only after you're comfortable with the fundamentals.
