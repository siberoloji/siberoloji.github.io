In web development, HTML serves as the backbone of web pages, providing essential structure for content and layout. As projects grow in complexity, maintaining clean, readable, and well-formatted HTML can become challenging. This is where code formatters come into play. They automate the formatting process, ensuring your HTML is consistently styled and easy to read. In this article, we’ll explore the importance of HTML code formatters, how they work, and review some popular options.



## What is an HTML Code Formatter?



An HTML code formatter automatically reformats HTML code to adhere to predefined style guidelines. These tools enhance the readability and maintainability of your HTML documents by addressing issues related to indentation, whitespace, and overall structure.
