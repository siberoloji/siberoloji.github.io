In the early 2000s, Microsoft embarked on an ambitious project known as Midori, which aimed to rethink the way operating systems were designed and implemented. While most people are familiar with Windows, Microsoft’s flagship operating system, few know about Midori, a project that could have potentially redefined computing. In this blog post, we’ll explore what Midori was, its groundbreaking features, why it never saw the light of day, and its lasting impact on modern operating systems.


#### 1. **What Was Midori?**



Midori was a research project initiated by Microsoft Research around 2008, spearheaded by a team led by Eric Rudder, a senior vice president at Microsoft at the time. It was intended to be a completely new operating system that moved away from the traditional concepts used in Windows. The goal was to create a highly modular, efficient, and secure system that could address the limitations of existing OS architectures.


* **A Departure from Windows:** Unlike Windows, which is built on the NT kernel and has its roots in the 1990s, Midori was designed from scratch. It aimed to leverage modern computing concepts such as cloud-based services, advanced concurrency, and a focus on safety and security.

* **Post-Windows Vision:** Midori was considered a “post-Windows” operating system, meaning it was not meant to replace Windows immediately but to explore what could be done differently if one were to start designing an OS with modern requirements in mind.



#### 2. **Key Features and Innovations of Midori**



Midori introduced several innovative concepts that set it apart from traditional operating systems like Windows, Linux, and macOS. Let’s take a closer look at some of its key features.


* **Singularity and Managed Code:** Midori was built on the foundation of another Microsoft project called Singularity. Singularity was a research OS that explored the use of managed code at the core of the operating system. In Midori, the entire system was intended to be written in managed code, specifically in a variant of C#. This would provide enhanced safety, as managed code environments prevent many common programming errors like buffer overflows and memory corruption.

* **Componentization:** Midori embraced a highly modular approach. Instead of monolithic applications, Midori used components that could be combined and reused in various configurations. This made the system more flexible and allowed for greater reusability of code.

* **Asynchronous Programming Model:** Midori heavily utilized asynchronous programming to handle concurrent operations. This was intended to make the system more responsive and better suited to the modern, multi-core, and distributed computing environments.

* **Distributed Computing and Cloud Integration:** One of the most forward-looking aspects of Midori was its native support for distributed computing. Midori was designed to seamlessly integrate with cloud services, allowing applications to span multiple devices and servers without requiring significant changes to the code.

* **Contract-Based Design:** Midori used a contract-based approach to manage interactions between components. This meant that every interaction had to adhere to a predefined contract, ensuring that components could only interact in safe and predictable ways. This would lead to more reliable and maintainable systems.

* **Advanced Security Features:** With security being a top priority, Midori was designed to minimize the attack surface. The use of managed code reduced the risk of many types of vulnerabilities, and the OS included robust isolation mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access between components.



#### 3. **Why Did Microsoft Develop Midori?**



The development of Midori was driven by the desire to address some of the fundamental challenges that existing operating systems were facing. Windows, for all its success, had several limitations that were becoming more apparent as computing environments evolved.


* **Legacy Code and Compatibility Issues:** Windows had accumulated a vast amount of legacy code, which made it difficult to innovate without breaking compatibility. Midori was an attempt to break free from this legacy burden.

* **Security Concerns:** As cyber threats became more sophisticated, the need for a more secure operating system became evident. Midori’s managed code approach aimed to mitigate many of the vulnerabilities that plagued traditional OS designs.

* **Scalability and Performance:** With the rise of multi-core processors and cloud computing, there was a need for an OS that could scale more efficiently. Midori’s design was inherently more scalable and capable of handling modern hardware and distributed computing environments.



#### 4. **Challenges and Reasons for Midori’s Cancellation**



Despite its innovative features, Midori never became a mainstream operating system. Several factors contributed to its cancellation:


* **Legacy Ecosystem:** One of the biggest challenges was the existing ecosystem of applications and hardware designed for Windows. Transitioning to a new OS with a different architecture would have required significant changes from both developers and users, making widespread adoption unlikely.

* **Internal Politics and Prioritization:** At Microsoft, Windows was still the primary focus, and it continued to generate significant revenue. Convincing the company to invest in a project that could potentially compete with its flagship product was challenging.

* **Technical Hurdles:** While Midori was groundbreaking in many ways, implementing some of its features proved difficult. The project faced challenges in making the managed code model performant enough for all use cases.

* **Shift in Company Strategy:** With the rise of cloud computing and Microsoft’s pivot towards cloud services under CEO Satya Nadella, the company’s focus shifted away from developing new client operating systems to enhancing its cloud and services portfolio.



#### 5. **Legacy and Impact of Midori**



Although Midori never became a commercial product, its influence can still be seen in several areas of modern computing.


* **.NET and C# Advancements:** The work done on Midori contributed to improvements in the .NET framework and the C# language, particularly in the areas of asynchronous programming and concurrency management.

* **Cloud and Distributed Computing:** Some of the concepts explored in Midori, such as native support for distributed computing, found their way into Microsoft’s cloud offerings, including Azure.

* **Componentization and Microservices:** The idea of building applications as a set of reusable components has parallels in the microservices architecture that is widely used in modern software development.

* **Security Best Practices:** Midori’s focus on security through managed code and contract-based interactions has influenced the design of secure systems and applications.



#### 6. **Lessons Learned from Midori**



The Midori project offers several lessons for both developers and organizations looking to innovate in the realm of operating systems and software development.


* **The Challenge of Legacy Systems:** Innovating in an environment with significant legacy constraints is difficult. Organizations need to balance the need for backward compatibility with the desire to push technology forward.

* **Importance of Vision and Focus:** While it’s essential to explore new ideas, projects like Midori show the importance of having a clear vision and focus. For Midori, conflicting priorities within Microsoft hindered its progress.

* **The Role of Research Projects:** Midori’s cancellation doesn’t mean it was a failure. Research projects like these are crucial for exploring new ideas and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible, even if they don’t always lead to a commercial product.



#### 7. **Conclusion: Midori’s Place in the History of Computing**



Midori remains one of the most ambitious and intriguing projects in Microsoft’s history. While it never became a commercial product, its influence is still felt in various aspects of modern computing. The ideas and technologies developed during the Midori project continue to inspire new approaches to operating system design and software development.



As we look to the future of computing, it’s clear that the challenges Midori aimed to address—such as security, scalability, and modularity—are more relevant than ever. While Midori itself may not have succeeded, the quest for a better, more secure, and more efficient operating system continues.
