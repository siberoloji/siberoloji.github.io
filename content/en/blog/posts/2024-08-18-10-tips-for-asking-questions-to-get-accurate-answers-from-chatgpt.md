Here are 10 tips for asking questions to get accurate answers from ChatGPT:



## **Be Specific:** 



Clearly define what you want to know. Avoid vague questions. Instead of asking, "Tell me about the weather," ask, "What's the weather like in New York City today?"



## **Provide Context:** 



If your question is part of a broader topic, give some background information. For example, "I’m writing a report on renewable energy. Can you explain how solar panels work?"



## **Use Clear Language:** 



Avoid jargon or overly complex language, especially if you're asking about a new topic. Simple and straightforward questions often yield the best results.



## **Break Down Complex Questions:** 



f your question has multiple parts, consider asking them one at a time. For example, instead of, "Can you tell me about the history, types, and future of artificial intelligence?" you could ask about each aspect separately.



## **Ask for Examples:** 



If you're learning something new, ask for examples to clarify concepts. For instance, "Can you give me an example of a metaphor in literature?"



## **Specify the Format:** 



If you need information in a specific format, mention it. For example, "Can you summarize the book in three sentences?" or "Can you list the key points?"



## **State Your Purpose:** 



Letting ChatGPT know what you’re aiming to achieve can help tailor the response. For example, "I'm preparing for an interview. How should I answer questions about my strengths and weaknesses?"



## **Use Follow-Up Questions:** 



If the first answer isn’t clear or doesn’t cover everything, feel free to ask follow-up questions for more detail.



## **Be Open to Rephrasing:** 



If the response doesn’t seem to match your expectation, try rephrasing the question. Sometimes a slight change in wording can make a big difference.



## **Stay Focused:** 



Try to keep your questions on one topic at a time. If you have multiple unrelated questions, ask them separately to keep the answers focused and relevant.

These tips should help you get the most accurate and useful responses from ChatGPT!
