2. Prerequisites Before Updating



Before updating your AlmaLinux 9 system, there are a few important steps to follow:


#### Backup Important Data



It’s always a good idea to back up critical files and databases before performing a system update. While updating AlmaLinux 9 is usually safe, unexpected issues can arise during the process. You can use tools like `rsync` or cloud-based solutions for backing up files.



For example, to back up the `/etc` directory, you can run:


```bash
sudo rsync -av /etc /backup/etc_backup
```


#### Ensure Adequate Disk Space



Updates can require significant disk space. Ensure your system has enough space by checking the disk usage:


```bash
df -h
```



If your `/boot` partition is full, you might need to clean up old kernels using:


```bash
sudo dnf remove old_kernel_package```


#### Check Network Connection



Ensure that your system has a reliable internet connection. If the update process is interrupted due to network issues, it can cause package inconsistencies.


#### Update Repository Metadata



Before starting the update, refresh the package metadata so you can download the latest packages:


```bash
sudo dnf makecache```





3. How to Check Your Current AlmaLinux Version



Before you begin the update process, it’s useful to verify which version of AlmaLinux you are currently running. You can check your system version with the following command:


```bash
cat /etc/os-release```



This will display output similar to:


```bash
NAME="AlmaLinux"
VERSION="9.1 (Lime Lynx)"
ID="almalinux"
VERSION_ID="9.1"```



Alternatively, you can use:


```bash
uname -r```



This command will display the kernel version you are using, which is helpful if you plan to upgrade the kernel.





4. Updating System Packages Using DNF



The **dnf** package manager is the tool used to update software packages in AlmaLinux 9. Running a full system update involves updating all installed packages to the latest versions available in the repositories.


#### Step 1: Check for Available Updates



To list all available updates, use the following command:


```bash
sudo dnf check-update```



This will list any packages that have updates available, allowing you to review them before proceeding.


#### Step 2: Update All Packages



To update all packages on the system, including the kernel and any software packages, run the following command:


```bash
sudo dnf upgrade```



This command will prompt you for confirmation before proceeding. It downloads and installs the latest packages from the AlmaLinux repositories, keeping your system up to date.


#### Step 3: Reboot After Updating



If the update includes a new kernel or critical system packages, it’s important to reboot your system to apply those changes:


```bash
sudo reboot```



This ensures the updated kernel and other critical services are running correctly.





5. Applying Security Updates



Security updates are crucial for keeping your system safe from vulnerabilities. AlmaLinux provides a way to install only security-related updates.


#### List Available Security Updates



To see which security updates are available, use:


```bash
sudo dnf updateinfo list security
```



This command will show a list of packages that have security updates available.


#### Install Security Updates Only



If you want to apply just the security updates, run:


```bash
sudo dnf upgrade --security
```



This command focuses only on updating packages related to security vulnerabilities, leaving other non-essential updates untouched.





6. Upgrading the Kernel



The Linux kernel is the core of the operating system. Upgrading the kernel ensures you benefit from the latest features, security patches, and performance improvements. AlmaLinux 9 will typically update the kernel during a full system update, but you can also do it manually.


#### List Installed Kernels



To see the currently installed kernels, run:


```bash
rpm -qa | grep kernel
```


#### Update the Kernel



To manually upgrade the kernel, use:


```bash
sudo dnf install kernel
```



After the kernel update, reboot your system for the new kernel to take effect:


```bash
sudo reboot```


#### Verify Kernel Version After Reboot



Once the system has rebooted, verify that the system is running the latest kernel:


```bash
uname -r```



The kernel version displayed should now reflect the most recent installation.





7. Automating Updates with DNF-Automatic



For users who want to keep their systems updated without manual intervention, **dnf-automatic** can be configured to automatically download and apply updates. This is particularly useful in environments where regular manual updates are not feasible.


#### Install DNF-Automatic



First, install the `dnf-automatic` package:


```bash
sudo dnf install dnf-automatic```


#### Configure DNF-Automatic



Once installed, configure the automatic updates by editing the configuration file:


```bash
sudo nano /etc/dnf/automatic.conf```



In this file, you can specify whether you want to automatically apply updates, download only, or receive email notifications.


#### Enable DNF-Automatic



Enable the `dnf-automatic` service to start it on boot:


```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now dnf-automatic.timer```



This will ensure that the system periodically checks for updates and applies them based on the configuration.





8. Best Practices for System Updates


* **Regularly Check for Updates**: Even if you have automated updates, it’s a good practice to manually check for updates periodically to stay aware of what’s changing on your system.

* **Test Updates in a Staging Environment**: In production environments, always test updates in a staging environment before applying them to critical systems. This ensures that the updates won’t break your applications or services.

* **Use `dnf history`**: The `dnf history` command allows you to review the history of updates and even rollback updates in case something goes wrong.



```bash
sudo dnf history
```


* **Monitor Update Logs**: Logs can provide valuable insights into the update process, especially if something goes wrong. You can view the logs using:



```bash
journalctl -xe```





9. Troubleshooting Common Update Issues



Despite the stability of AlmaLinux 9, you may encounter occasional issues during system updates. Below are some common problems and how to resolve them:


#### Package Conflicts



Sometimes, you may encounter package conflicts when updating the system. The error message will usually tell you which packages are in conflict. To resolve package conflicts, you can remove the conflicting package:


```bash
sudo dnf remove package_name```



Then retry the update:


```bash
sudo dnf upgrade```


#### Incomplete Transactions



If an update is interrupted (e.g., due to a network issue), you may need to clean up and retry the update:


```bash
sudo dnf clean all
sudo dnf upgrade```



This clears the package cache and refreshes the repository metadata.


#### Kernel Boot Issues



If your system fails to boot after a kernel update, you can select a previous kernel from the boot menu (GRUB). You can make an older kernel the default if necessary by editing the GRUB configuration file.





10. Conclusion



Updating your **AlmaLinux 9** system is a straightforward process with the **dnf** package manager. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can ensure your system stays secure, stable, and up to date with the latest features and patches.
