## What is System76?

Founded in 2005, **System76** is a hardware manufacturer that designs and builds computers optimized for Linux operating systems. Their mission is simple yet profound: to provide users with machines that are fully compatible with open-source software while promoting user freedom. Over the years, they have developed a reputation as a go-to provider for Linux enthusiasts, developers, and professionals who prioritize transparency, privacy, and customization in their computing experiences.

The company differentiates itself by not only offering powerful hardware but also an integrated **Linux-based operating system**—**Pop!_OS**—designed to meet the needs of engineers, creators, and gamers. System76 aims to offer an experience free from the proprietary limitations and restrictions common in many mainstream computer brands.

## System76's Commitment to Open-Source

At its core, System76 stands out because of its commitment to open-source principles, both in terms of software and, more recently, hardware.

1. **Open-Source Software**

System76’s machines primarily run Linux, and while they originally offered **Ubuntu** (one of the most popular Linux distributions), in 2017, the company developed its own Linux distribution: **Pop!_OS**. Built on Ubuntu, Pop!_OS is tailored specifically for System76 hardware, providing users with a sleek, powerful, and highly customizable desktop experience.

Pop!_OS has become known for its **user-friendly design**, making it a preferred choice not just for Linux veterans but also for newcomers transitioning from Windows or macOS.

2. **Open-Source Hardware with Thelio**

In 2018, System76 took a major step toward hardware openness with the introduction of thelio**, a line of desktop computers designed and manufactured in-house. The Thelio series represents the company’s first venture into open-source hardware, as it is designed using **open hardware schematics**. This means that users can see the inner workings of their machines and even modify or improve upon them if they wish. This level of transparency is rare in the hardware market and gives users unprecedented control over their systems.

By blending open-source software with open hardware, System76 is empowering users to have complete ownership and control over their devices—something that mainstream tech companies don’t usually provide.

## Key Products from System76

System76 offers a range of products, from laptops to desktops and servers, all built to perform seamlessly with Linux. Here’s a look at some of their key offerings:

1. **Laptops**

System76 laptops are tailored for various use cases, from general productivity to high-performance computing for developers and creatives. They offer different models, including:
* **Lemur Pro**: A lightweight laptop designed for users who need portability and long battery life without sacrificing performance.

* **Oryx Pro**: A high-end laptop offering powerful NVIDIA graphics cards, ideal for gaming, 3D modeling, and intensive computing tasks.

* **Darter Pro**: A balance between portability and power, suitable for professionals who need performance on the go.
What makes System76 laptops unique is the fact that they are optimized for Linux right out of the box, ensuring that all hardware components—from the CPU to the touchpad—work perfectly with the operating system.

2. **Desktops**

The company offers a range of desktop computers designed for power users who need high-performance machines for tasks like data science, AI, gaming, and creative work:
* thelio**: A customizable desktop tower available in various configurations. The Thelio series includes models like thelio Major**, thelio Mega**, and thelio Mira**, each designed for different levels of performance.

* **Meerkat**: A compact desktop computer that packs a punch despite its small form factor. The Meerkat is ideal for users who need a minimalist setup without compromising on power.
3. **Servers**

System76 also caters to enterprise users with a line of servers designed for scalability, high availability, and performance. Their **Serval WS** (workstation) series provides heavy-duty computing for industries like software development, AI, and scientific computing.

4. thelio Io**

Recently, System76 expanded into **embedded systems** with thelio Io**, a custom-built motherboard for the Thelio desktop series. Thelio Io is designed specifically for Linux, with advanced cooling and power management features. It’s a significant step toward fully open-source hardware, as this move gives System76 even more control over their hardware’s design and manufacturing.

## Pop!_OS: A Linux Distribution for Everyone
