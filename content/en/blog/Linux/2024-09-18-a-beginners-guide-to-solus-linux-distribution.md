If you’re a Linux beginner looking for a clean, efficient, and beginner-friendly operating system, **Solus Linux distribution** is an excellent choice. <a href="https://getsol.us" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">Solus Linux </a>is a relatively new player in the Linux ecosystem but has been making waves with its polished user interface, performance, and simplicity. It is built from scratch, independent of other distributions, and is well-optimized for desktops, making it a perfect entry point for people who are transitioning from other operating systems like Windows or macOS.



In this blog post, we'll take you through the basics of the Solus Linux distribution and explain why it's a great option for beginners. You'll learn about its features, how to install it, and how to get started with the software that will make your computing experience better and more efficient.



## 1. What is Solus Linux?



Solus is a Linux distribution developed with a primary focus on desktop computing. It’s designed to be user-friendly, fast, and responsive, and aims to provide an intuitive experience, particularly for those new to Linux.



Unlike some other Linux distributions like Ubuntu, Fedora, or Debian, which are built on older, more established distributions, **Solus is built from scratch**. This makes it unique in its approach to development and functionality. Its development is community-driven and independent, which allows Solus to innovate without being constrained by the decisions of upstream distributions.



Key Features of Solus:


* **Independent Distribution**: Solus is not based on another distribution like Ubuntu or Debian. It is built from the ground up.

* **Rolling Release**: Unlike some fixed-point releases, Solus uses a rolling release model, meaning you’ll always have access to the latest software updates without needing to perform major upgrades.

* **Focus on Desktop Experience**: The main focus of Solus is providing an optimized and user-friendly desktop environment.

* **Software Choices**: Solus comes pre-installed with essential software, and it offers a variety of applications through its package manager.




## 2. Why Solus is Ideal for Beginners



Choosing the right Linux distribution can be daunting, especially if you’re just starting out. Here's why Solus is an ideal option for beginners:



a) User-Friendly Interface



Solus provides a modern and elegant desktop environment called **Budgie**, developed by the Solus team. The Budgie desktop is intuitive and visually appealing, making it a great choice for users transitioning from more traditional operating systems like Windows or macOS.



The layout of Budgie is simple, featuring a taskbar at the bottom (similar to Windows), an easy-to-navigate menu, and notifications. It doesn’t overwhelm beginners with unnecessary options, focusing instead on delivering a straightforward user experience.



Solus also offers other desktop environments like **GNOME, KDE Plasma,** and **MATE**, so users can select the desktop environment they’re most comfortable with.



b) Pre-installed Applications



Solus comes with many pre-installed applications that cover everyday computing tasks. These include:


* **Firefox** for web browsing

* **Thunderbird** for email management

* **LibreOffice** for productivity (word processing, spreadsheets, presentations)

* **Rhythmbox** for music

* **GNOME MPV** for video playback




Having these essential applications out of the box saves beginners from the hassle of searching for and installing basic software after setting up the system.



c) Rolling Release Model



One of the significant advantages of Solus is its rolling release model. With this model, you continuously receive the latest updates and new features without needing to perform full system upgrades, unlike distributions such as Ubuntu, which has biannual releases.



This ensures that your system is always up to date, providing a stable and secure computing experience without requiring you to reinstall your OS to get the latest features.



d) Easy Software Management



Solus uses **eopkg**, its package management system, which makes installing, updating, and removing software a breeze. Beginners will appreciate the **Software Center**, a graphical tool that simplifies the process of managing applications. You can browse categories like Internet, Office, Games, Multimedia, and more, with just a few clicks.



Furthermore, Solus supports **Flatpak**, which is a universal package format that makes it easy to install software that isn’t available in Solus's native repositories.



## 3. How to Install Solus Linux



Installing Solus is a simple and streamlined process. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you install Solus on your computer.



a) Download the Solus ISO



To start, you need to download the Solus ISO image from the official website. You can choose between different editions:


* **Solus Budgie**: Featuring the Budgie desktop, optimized for simplicity and ease of use.

* **Solus GNOME**: Uses the GNOME desktop, suitable for users who prefer a more modern and customizable desktop experience.

* **Solus KDE Plasma**: For users who want a more traditional desktop with rich customization options.

* **Solus MATE**: A lightweight and traditional desktop environment that’s resource-efficient.




b) Create a Bootable USB Drive



Once you've downloaded the ISO, you’ll need to create a bootable USB drive. You can use a tool like **Rufus** (for Windows) or **Etcher** (for macOS and Linux) to write the ISO file to a USB drive.



c) Boot from the USB Drive



Insert the bootable USB into your computer and restart it. During boot, press the appropriate key to enter your BIOS or boot menu (this key is usually F12, F2, ESC, or DEL, depending on your computer). Select the USB drive as your boot option, and you’ll be taken to the Solus live environment.



d) Install Solus



Once you've booted into the live environment, you can try out Solus before installing it. If you’re ready to install, click on the **Install OS** icon on the desktop. The installer will guide you through the process:


* Select your language and region.

* Set up your keyboard layout.

* Choose your installation type (custom partitioning or automatic).

* Set your username and password.




After completing these steps, the installation will begin. Once it’s finished, you’ll be prompted to reboot your computer.



## 4. Getting Started with Solus



Once you’ve installed Solus, here are a few essential things to get you started.



a) Updating Your System



After installation, it's important to ensure your system is up to date. To update Solus, open the terminal and type:


```cpp
sudo eopkg upgrade```



Alternatively, you can use the **Software Center** to check for updates and install them through a graphical interface.



b) Installing Additional Software



Solus has a rich software repository, but if you need additional applications, you can easily install them via the Software Center or by using the terminal.



For example, to install **VLC media player**, you can use the following command:


```cpp
sudo eopkg install vlc```



For software that isn’t available in the default repositories, you can also use **Flatpak**. Flatpak comes pre-installed on Solus, so you can start using it right away. Just search for the app you need on Flathub, the official repository for Flatpak apps, and follow the installation instructions.



c) Customizing Your Desktop



One of the benefits of using Solus, especially with the Budgie desktop, is its ease of customization. You can change themes, icons, and window behavior through the **Budgie Desktop Settings**. If you're using GNOME, KDE, or MATE, you'll have their respective customization options.



Play around with themes and extensions to make your desktop environment look and feel exactly how you want.



## 5. Solus Community and Support



Although Solus is user-friendly, beginners might still face occasional challenges. Fortunately, the Solus community is active and helpful. You can find support through:


* **Solus Forum**: A great place to ask questions and find solutions to common issues.

* **Solus Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and resources for using Solus.

* **IRC and Reddit**: For more immediate assistance or casual discussions.




## Final Thoughts



Solus Linux is a solid choice for beginners who want a stable, user-friendly, and well-supported Linux distribution. Its focus on simplicity, combined with the power of a rolling release model, makes it a great operating system for users looking for an efficient desktop experience. With a sleek interface, straightforward installation process, and a wealth of pre-installed software, Solus removes much of the friction often associated with starting out in the Linux world.
