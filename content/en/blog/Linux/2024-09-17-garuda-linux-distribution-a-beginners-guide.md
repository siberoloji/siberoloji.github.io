Garuda Linux is a relatively new player in the world of Linux distributions, but it has quickly gained popularity due to its stunning visual appeal, performance optimization, and user-friendly features. As a beginner, diving into Linux can sometimes feel overwhelming with so many different distributions (also known as “distros”) to choose from. Garuda Linux, however, positions itself as an attractive option for those who are new to the Linux environment but still want power and flexibility. This blog post will guide you through Garuda Linux, why it's a great choice for beginners, and how to get started with it.



What is Garuda Linux?



Garuda Linux is a rolling release distribution based on Arch Linux, which means that instead of having major updates every few months, your system is continuously updated with the latest software packages. However, unlike Arch Linux, which is often considered challenging for beginners due to its manual setup process, Garuda Linux is designed to be easy to install and use, even for those with little or no experience in Linux.



Garuda Linux comes with a wide range of desktop environments and user interfaces, from KDE Plasma, GNOME, and XFCE, to more specialized environments like i3WM and Wayfire. These various desktop environments give users the freedom to choose one that best suits their personal workflow and aesthetic preferences.



Garuda Linux is not only beginner-friendly but also optimized for performance. It uses tools like Btrfs as its default file system, which supports automatic snapshots and system rollback capabilities, ensuring that even if something goes wrong, you can quickly restore your system to a working state. Additionally, Garuda Linux has pre-configured settings designed to improve system speed and responsiveness, making it an attractive choice for gamers, developers, and content creators alike.



Why Should Beginners Choose Garuda Linux?



Here are some reasons why Garuda Linux stands out as an excellent choice for Linux newcomers:


#### 1. **User-Friendly Installation Process**



One of the biggest barriers for beginners when it comes to using Arch Linux is its installation process, which is entirely manual. Garuda Linux, on the other hand, provides a simple and intuitive installation experience thanks to the Calamares installer. This graphical installer makes it easy to set up Garuda Linux without having to deal with the command line or manually configuring the system, which can be daunting for new users. All you need to do is select your preferred desktop environment, partition your drives, and click install. It’s as straightforward as installing any mainstream operating system like Windows or macOS.


#### 2. **Beautiful and Customizable User Interface**



Garuda Linux’s default desktop environment, KDE Plasma, is one of the most visually appealing interfaces in the Linux world. It is sleek, modern, and comes with a wide variety of customization options. Whether you prefer a minimalist setup or a more vibrant and complex desktop, Garuda Linux allows you to tailor the look and feel of your system to your liking.



In addition to KDE Plasma, Garuda Linux offers other desktop environments such as GNOME, Cinnamon, and XFCE, which are all polished and designed for different types of users. Beginners who are used to other operating systems like Windows will appreciate how easy it is to navigate and configure these environments.


#### 3. **Performance Optimization**



One of Garuda Linux's key selling points is its out-of-the-box performance optimization. It comes pre-configured with tools like `ZRAM`, which enhances system performance by compressing RAM, and `NoHang`, which prevents system freezes. Garuda also applies performance tweaks and kernel optimizations, ensuring that your system runs smoothly even if you're not a Linux expert.



Garuda’s performance-oriented design makes it a great choice not just for casual users but also for gamers. It includes a dedicated edition called "Garuda Linux Gaming Edition" that comes with pre-installed gaming utilities such as Steam, Lutris, and various other emulators. This means you can jump straight into gaming without needing to manually configure any software or drivers.


#### 4. **Btrfs and Timeshift for System Snapshots**



Garuda Linux uses the Btrfs file system by default, which offers several advantages over more traditional file systems like EXT4. One of the key features of Btrfs is its support for snapshots, which are essentially point-in-time copies of your system. Garuda integrates Btrfs with Timeshift, a tool that automatically creates and manages system snapshots. This feature is incredibly useful for beginners, as it allows you to easily roll back your system to a previous state if an update or system change causes problems.



This system of automatic snapshots provides peace of mind for users who are still learning the ropes. No matter what goes wrong, you can quickly restore your system to a functional state without losing any important files or settings.


#### 5. **The Garuda Assistant**



Another tool that makes Garuda Linux beginner-friendly is the Garuda Assistant. This is a graphical tool that allows users to perform common system maintenance tasks, such as updating the system, clearing cache, managing system snapshots, and more, all through an easy-to-use interface. The Garuda Assistant significantly reduces the need for terminal commands, making it easier for beginners to manage and maintain their system without having to learn complicated Linux commands right away.


#### 6. **Rolling Release Model**



As mentioned earlier, Garuda Linux follows a rolling release model, meaning you get the latest software and updates as soon as they are available. For beginners, this means you won't have to worry about reinstalling or upgrading your system every six months or so, which is common with other Linux distributions like Ubuntu or Fedora. Your system stays current with the latest software versions, security patches, and bug fixes.



However, while rolling releases have their advantages, they can sometimes introduce instability, as new updates may not be thoroughly tested before being released. Thankfully, Garuda’s snapshot system mitigates this risk, allowing you to easily revert your system to a previous state if an update causes issues.



Getting Started with Garuda Linux



Now that we’ve covered why Garuda Linux is a great choice for beginners, let’s go over how you can get started.


#### 1. **Download Garuda Linux**



You can download Garuda Linux from its official website. Choose the edition that best suits your needs. If you're not sure which desktop environment to go with, the "Garuda KDE Dr460nized Edition" is a great choice for beginners, thanks to its user-friendly and polished KDE Plasma desktop.


#### 2. **Create a Bootable USB**



Once you've downloaded the ISO file, you'll need to create a bootable USB drive to install Garuda Linux on your computer. You can use tools like `Rufus` (on Windows) or `Etcher` (on Linux and macOS) to do this. Simply insert your USB drive, select the Garuda Linux ISO file, and let the tool do the rest.


#### 3. **Install Garuda Linux**



After creating the bootable USB, restart your computer and boot from the USB drive. You may need to press a specific key (usually `F12`, `ESC`, or `DEL`) to bring up the boot menu. From there, select your USB drive and boot into the Garuda Linux live environment.



Once in the live environment, you can explore Garuda Linux before committing to an installation. When you’re ready, click on the "Install Garuda Linux" icon on the desktop and follow the on-screen instructions. The Calamares installer will guide you through the process, which is straightforward and beginner-friendly.


#### 4. **Post-Installation**



Once Garuda Linux is installed, you'll be greeted with a beautiful and responsive desktop environment. Before you start using your new system, it's a good idea to update your software packages. You can do this through the Garuda Assistant or by using the following terminal command:


```cpp
sudo pacman -Syu```



After updating, you're ready to start exploring Garuda Linux and all the features it has to offer!



Conclusion



Garuda Linux is an excellent choice for beginners who want a powerful, visually appealing, and easy-to-use Linux distribution. Its user-friendly installer, beautiful interface, performance optimizations, and powerful system tools make it a great option for those new to the Linux world. Whether you're a casual user, a gamer, or someone looking to learn more about Linux, Garuda Linux provides a smooth and enjoyable experience. Give it a try, and you'll quickly see why it's become one of the most talked-about distributions in the Linux community!
