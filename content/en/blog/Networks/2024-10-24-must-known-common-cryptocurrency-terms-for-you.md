* **Consensus Mechanism**: The method by which nodes in a blockchain network agree on the validity of transactions. Common mechanisms include Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS).

* **Proof of Work (PoW)**: A consensus mechanism that requires miners to solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions.

* **Proof of Stake (PoS)**: A consensus mechanism where validators are chosen based on the number of tokens they hold and are willing to "stake" as collateral.

* **Smart Contract**: A self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement directly written into code, which automatically enforces the terms of the agreement.

* **Gas Fee**: A fee paid to execute transactions or smart contracts on blockchain platforms like Ethereum.

* **Fork**: A change or split in a blockchain’s protocol that creates two separate versions of the blockchain. Forks can be "hard" (permanent) or "soft" (temporary).

* **Private Key**: A secret cryptographic code used to access and control a cryptocurrency wallet. It should never be shared.

* **Hot Wallet**: A cryptocurrency wallet that is connected to the internet, such as those on exchanges. While convenient, hot wallets are more susceptible to hacking.

* **Cold Wallet**: A cryptocurrency wallet that is not connected to the internet, often stored on a hardware device or paper, and is more secure than a hot wallet.

* **Seed Phrase**: A sequence of words generated by a wallet that allows the user to recover their funds if they lose access to the wallet. It must be stored securely.

* **2FA (Two-Factor Authentication)**: An extra layer of security used to protect accounts by requiring a second form of verification, such as a text message code, in addition to a password.

* **Encryption**: The process of converting data into a coded form to prevent unauthorized access.

* **Multi-Signature (Multisig)**: A security feature where multiple parties must approve a transaction before it is executed.

* **Phishing**: A fraudulent attempt to obtain sensitive information by disguising as a trustworthy entity, often through fake websites or emails.



 


## 4. Trading and Investment Terms

* **Market Cap (Market Capitalization)**: The total value of a cryptocurrency, calculated by multiplying its current price by its total supply.

* **Bull Market**: A market characterized by rising prices and optimism among investors.

* **Bear Market**: A market characterized by declining prices and pessimism among investors.

* **Limit Order**: An order to buy or sell a cryptocurrency at a specific price or better.
