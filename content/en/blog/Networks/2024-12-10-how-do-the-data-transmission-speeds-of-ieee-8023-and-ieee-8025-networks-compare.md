The data transmission speeds of IEEE 802.3 (Ethernet) and IEEE 802.5 (Token Ring) differ significantly, reflecting their respective design philosophies and technological advancements. Here’s a detailed comparison of their data transmission speeds:

## Data Transmission Speeds

### IEEE 802.3 (Ethernet)

- **Original Speed**: The original IEEE 802.3 standard specified a data rate of **10 Mbps**.
- **Fast Ethernet**: The subsequent standard, IEEE 802.3u, introduced **Fast Ethernet**, which operates at **100 Mbps**.
- **Gigabit Ethernet**: Later developments included IEEE 802.3z and 802.3ab, which support **1 Gbps (1000 Mbps)**.
- **10 Gigabit Ethernet**: The standard evolved further with IEEE 802.3ae, enabling speeds of **10 Gbps**.
- **Higher Speeds**: More recent standards have pushed Ethernet capabilities to **40 Gbps**, **100 Gbps**, and even beyond, with standards like IEEE 802.3ba.

### IEEE 802.5 (Token Ring)

- **Original Speed**: The initial versions of Token Ring (IEEE 802.5) operated at speeds of **4 Mbps** and later at **16 Mbps**.
- **Enhanced Versions**: Extensions such as IEEE 802.5t allowed for speeds up to **100 Mbps**, while IEEE 802.5v provided capabilities for speeds of **1 Gbps** over fiber optics.

## Comparison Summary

| Feature                       | IEEE 802.3 (Ethernet)               | IEEE 802.5 (Token Ring)              |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Original Speed**            | 10 Mbps                             | 4 Mbps                               |
| **Fast Ethernet Speed**       | 100 Mbps                            | N/A                                   |
| **Gigabit Ethernet Speed**    | 1 Gbps                              | N/A                                   |
| **10 Gigabit Ethernet Speed** | Up to 10 Gbps                       | N/A                                   |
| **Maximum Speed (Recent)**    | Up to 400 Gbps+                     | Up to 1 Gbps over fiber              |

## Conclusion

In summary, IEEE 802.3 (Ethernet) significantly outpaces IEEE 802.5 (Token Ring) in terms of data transmission speeds. While Token Ring started with lower speeds and has limited enhancements, Ethernet has continuously evolved to support much higher data rates, making it the preferred choice for modern enterprise networks where high-speed data transmission is crucial. The scalability and flexibility of Ethernet further enhance its appeal compared to Token Ring's more rigid structure and lower performance capabilities.
