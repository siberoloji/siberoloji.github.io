* **Streamlined Installation**: Installing and updating Airgeddon on Kali Linux is straightforward.

* **Strong Community and Documentation**: Kali’s large user base offers numerous resources, tutorials, and community support.

Installing Airgeddon on Kali Linux



Airgeddon is not pre-installed on Kali Linux, but installation is simple. Follow these steps to set up Airgeddon on your Kali Linux system:


* **Update Kali Linux**:



```bash
   sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt upgrade```


<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"start":2} -->
<ol start="2" class="wp-block-list">* **Install Git (if not already installed)**:



```bash
   sudo apt install git```


<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"start":3} -->
<ol start="3" class="wp-block-list">* **Clone the Airgeddon Repository**:



```bash
   git clone https://github.com/v1s1t0r1sh3r3/airgeddon.git```


<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"start":4} -->
<ol start="4" class="wp-block-list">* **Navigate to the Airgeddon Directory**:



```bash
   cd airgeddon
```


<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"start":5} -->
<ol start="5" class="wp-block-list">* **Run Airgeddon**:



```bash
   sudo bash airgeddon.sh
```



Running this command will launch Airgeddon’s interface, and you’re ready to start using its various features.
Core Functionalities of Airgeddon



Airgeddon provides a range of wireless security auditing functions that streamline the process of assessing network vulnerabilities. Below, we’ll explore some of its most powerful capabilities.


#### 1. **Wireless Network Scanning and Reconnaissance**


* Airgeddon can scan nearby wireless networks, listing details such as SSIDs, encryption types, and signal strengths.

* It uses Airodump-ng to capture packets, providing you with essential data for further testing and analysis.



#### 2. **Handshake Capture and Password Cracking**


* Airgeddon supports WPA/WPA2 handshake captures, which are essential for testing the security of network passwords.

* You can use Airgeddon to perform deauthentication attacks to capture handshakes and then crack them using Aircrack-ng or Hashcat, depending on your preference.



#### 3. **Evil Twin Attacks**


* This function allows you to create a fake access point (AP) resembling a legitimate one. When users connect to the evil twin, it enables data capture and man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

* Airgeddon simplifies the setup of an evil twin attack, allowing you to collect data for further analysis.



#### 4. **Deauthentication Attacks**


* Deauthentication attacks force users to disconnect and reconnect to a Wi-Fi network, which can be helpful for testing network stability and capturing handshakes.

* Airgeddon uses Aireplay-ng to send deauthentication packets, making it easier to isolate devices and gather data for password cracking.



#### 5. **WEP, WPA, WPA2 Security Testing**


* Airgeddon supports auditing WEP, WPA, and WPA2 security protocols, allowing you to evaluate the robustness of different encryption standards.

* It simplifies the process of conducting attacks on outdated WEP networks or more secure WPA2 networks, letting you assess the security of each encryption type.



#### 6. **Phishing and MITM Attacks**


* Airgeddon supports phishing through captive portals, where users are redirected to a login page that mimics a real network login page.

* This feature is commonly used in testing network susceptibility to phishing and MITM attacks.



#### 7. **Hash Cracking Support with Hashcat**


* Airgeddon integrates with Hashcat, a popular password-cracking tool that uses GPU acceleration for rapid hash cracking.

* By leveraging captured hashes and using a dictionary or brute-force attack with Hashcat, you can test the strength of passwords and learn about the time and resources required for successful cracking.

Typical Workflow for Wireless Auditing with Airgeddon



Using Airgeddon involves a systematic approach to test the security of a wireless network. Below is a sample workflow to get started:


#### 1. Start Airgeddon



Launch Airgeddon with the following command:


```bash
sudo bash airgeddon.sh
```



This command will open a user-friendly interface that guides you through different options. Choose your network interface, enabling monitor mode if necessary.


#### 2. Scan for Nearby Networks



Select the network scanning option to view all nearby wireless networks, including their SSIDs, signal strengths, and encryption types. Identify the target network for testing and take note of its relevant details (e.g., channel, SSID, and BSSID).


#### 3. Capture WPA Handshake



Once you’ve selected a target network, use Airgeddon to capture the WPA/WPA2 handshake, which is essential for testing password security. If needed, perform a deauthentication attack to force devices to reconnect, making it easier to capture the handshake.


#### 4. Launch an Evil Twin Attack (Optional)



If testing for social engineering vulnerabilities, launch an evil twin attack to create a fake access point that mirrors the legitimate network. This option allows you to capture data and test how users interact with the fake network.


#### 5. Attempt Password Cracking



Once you’ve captured the necessary handshake, use Airgeddon’s integration with Aircrack-ng or Hashcat to attempt to crack the Wi-Fi password. Choose a suitable dictionary file or configure Hashcat to use brute force.


#### 6. Generate Reports and Analyze Findings



After testing, Airgeddon provides options to generate logs and reports, which are useful for documenting your findings and making security recommendations. Ensure that sensitive data is handled responsibly and by ethical guidelines.
Ethical Considerations and Legal Implications



Airgeddon is a powerful tool, but its use requires a responsible and ethical approach. Unauthorized use of Airgeddon can lead to severe legal consequences, as using it to test or access networks without permission is illegal.



**Ethical Guidelines for Using Airgeddon**:


* **Permission is Key**: Only use Airgeddon on networks you have explicit permission to audit.

* **Confidentiality**: Do not misuse sensitive information obtained during tests.

* **Report Findings Responsibly**: When conducting tests for a client or employer, provide detailed and actionable reports without sharing unauthorized data.

* **Operate Within Legal Boundaries**: Always adhere to legal regulations in your country or region regarding penetration testing.




Following these guidelines helps maintain ethical standards and prevents misuse of Airgeddon’s capabilities.
Advantages and Limitations of Airgeddon


#### **Advantages**


* **Comprehensive Toolset**: Airgeddon combines multiple tools into one, making it easier to conduct wireless security tests without needing to switch between programs.

* **User-Friendly Interface**: Its menu-driven interface simplifies the process of conducting wireless attacks, making it accessible to beginners and professionals.

* **Versatile Functionality**: Airgeddon covers everything from password cracking to MITM attacks, making it ideal for in-depth wireless security assessments.



#### **Limitations**


* **Hardware Compatibility**: Some wireless network adapters do not support packet injection or monitor mode, which limits Airgeddon’s functionality.

* **Dependency on Third-Party Tools**: Airgeddon relies on several other tools (e.g., Aircrack-ng, Hashcat) that may require individual updates or configurations.

* **Legal Risks**: Misusing Airgeddon can lead to significant legal repercussions, so it’s essential to use it responsibly.

Conclusion
