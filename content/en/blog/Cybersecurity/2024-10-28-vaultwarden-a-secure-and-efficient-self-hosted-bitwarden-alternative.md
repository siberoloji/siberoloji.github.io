In today’s digital age, keeping passwords secure is paramount. For many, Bitwarden has become the go-to password manager, offering reliable, open-source software that helps keep personal data safe. But for those looking for a self-hosted alternative that requires fewer resources, Vaultwarden emerges as an excellent solution. This post will dive into what Vaultwarden is, how it works, its key features, and the steps to set it up securely.
What is Vaultwarden?



<a href="https://www.vaultwarden.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">Vaultwarden</a>, formerly known as "Bitwarden_rs," is an open-source, self-hosted password manager that serves as a lightweight alternative to Bitwarden. Built on Rust, Vaultwarden enables users to set up their own secure, private password management server with minimal resource requirements. It’s an especially attractive solution for users on smaller systems, like Raspberry Pi or lower-end virtual private servers (VPS).



While Vaultwarden mimics Bitwarden’s core functionalities, it stands out for its efficiency and flexibility in deployment, offering the same level of security without some of the more resource-intensive components.
Key Benefits of Using Vaultwarden



Choosing Vaultwarden as your password management solution offers several unique advantages:


* **Lightweight and Efficient** Vaultwarden is designed to be efficient, consuming fewer resources compared to the full Bitwarden server. This efficiency makes it ideal for users who want to host their password manager on hardware with limited processing power.

* **Control and Privacy** By self-hosting Vaultwarden, users maintain full control over their data, ensuring it remains secure and private. This is especially important for users who prefer not to entrust their passwords to third-party services.

* **Cost-Effective** Vaultwarden is entirely free to use, and since it requires fewer resources, it can be hosted on low-cost servers or even a Raspberry Pi.

* **Customizable Setup** Vaultwarden provides flexibility in terms of customization, allowing users to modify settings to suit specific security or usability requirements.

* **Compatibility with Bitwarden Clients** Despite being a different backend, Vaultwarden is fully compatible with the official Bitwarden clients (web, desktop, mobile, and browser extensions), making it simple for Bitwarden users to transition.

Core Features of Vaultwarden



Vaultwarden offers a range of features that mirror those found in the Bitwarden server:


* **Password Storage and Management** Store all your passwords securely, organize them into folders, and manage them across devices through the web, desktop, or mobile clients.

* **Two-factor authentication (2FA)** Vaultwarden supports two-factor authentication, adding an extra layer of security to your login credentials.

* **Password Generation** Generate strong, unique passwords for each account to enhance security and reduce the likelihood of unauthorized access.

* **Encrypted Storage** All data stored in Vaultwarden is encrypted, ensuring that even if someone gains access to your server, they won’t be able to read your passwords.

* **Secure Sharing** Vaultwarden supports sharing passwords securely with family or team members, a crucial feature for collaborative work environments.

* **API Support** Vaultwarden supports the same API as Bitwarden, making it compatible with most Bitwarden-compatible applications and integrations.

Vaultwarden vs. Bitwarden: Key Differences



While Vaultwarden and Bitwarden share a lot in common, there are some notable differences:


<!-- wp:table -->
<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><thead><tr><th>Feature</th><th>Bitwarden</th><th>Vaultwarden</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>**Programming Language**</td><td>C#</td><td>Rust</td></tr><tr><td>**Hosting**</td><td>Official cloud-hosted or self-hosted with Bitwarden server</td><td>Self-hosted</td></tr><tr><td>**Resource Usage**</td><td>Higher</td><td>Lower (ideal for lightweight servers)</td></tr><tr><td>**Extensions and Clients**</td><td>Official Bitwarden clients</td><td>Compatible with Bitwarden clients</td></tr><tr><td>**Community-Driven**</td><td>Primarily by Bitwarden Inc.</td><td>Community-driven (open-source)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<!-- /wp:table -->


Vaultwarden’s leaner, Rust-based architecture is less demanding on server resources than Bitwarden’s official C# server, making it better suited for lower-end devices. However, Bitwarden’s official server has support from Bitwarden Inc., including prompt updates and enterprise-grade features.
How to Set Up Vaultwarden: Step-by-Step Guide



Setting up Vaultwarden is straightforward and can be completed on a variety of operating systems and devices. Here’s a step-by-step guide for installing Vaultwarden using Docker, one of the most popular deployment methods.


#### Prerequisites


* **Docker**: Ensure Docker is installed on your system. Docker simplifies deployment and makes it easy to update Vaultwarden.

* **Basic Command Line Knowledge**: Some familiarity with terminal commands will be helpful.

* **Domain (Optional but Recommended)**: A custom domain enhances accessibility and is often essential for securing the setup with SSL.



#### Step 1: Pull the Vaultwarden Docker Image



To get started, pull the Vaultwarden Docker image from Docker Hub. Open a terminal and enter:


```bash
docker pull vaultwarden/server:latest```


#### Step 2: Create a Directory for Data Storage



Create a directory where Vaultwarden can store its data. This ensures your data persists even if the container is updated or restarted.


```bash
mkdir -p ~/vaultwarden/data
```


#### Step 3: Run the Vaultwarden Docker Container



Now, you’re ready to run the Vaultwarden Docker container. Use the following command:


```bash
docker run -d --name vaultwarden -v ~/vaultwarden/data:/data -p 80:80 vaultwarden/server:latest```



This command launches Vaultwarden and binds it to port 80. If you prefer to use a different port, replace `80` with your chosen port number.


#### Step 4: Set Up HTTPS (Recommended)



For secure access, it’s important to set up HTTPS. The easiest way to do this is by using a reverse proxy like **NGINX** and generating an SSL certificate with **Let’s Encrypt**.


* **Install NGINX** on your server.

* **Configure a Reverse Proxy** in NGINX to direct traffic to the Vaultwarden container.

* Use **Certbot** to generate and manage your SSL certificate.




Example NGINX configuration for Vaultwarden:


```bash
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:80;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```


#### Step 5: Access Vaultwarden



After completing these steps, you should be able to access your Vaultwarden instance through your web browser. Go to your server’s IP address or domain name to reach the Vaultwarden login page.
Securing Your Vaultwarden Setup



When dealing with sensitive data, security is essential. Here are some best practices to secure your Vaultwarden server:


* **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** Use a 2FA app to add an extra layer of security.

* **Regular Backups** Vaultwarden stores data locally, so regular backups of the `/data` directory are crucial. This will ensure that you can restore your Vaultwarden instance if anything happens to your server.

* **Restrict Access to Your Server** Use firewall rules to limit access to your Vaultwarden instance. Only trusted IP addresses should have SSH access to the server.

* **Keep Your Server-Updated** Regularly update Docker, your OS, and any packages to ensure you have the latest security patches.

* **Use Strong Passwords** Make sure to use a strong, unique master password to secure Vaultwarden.
