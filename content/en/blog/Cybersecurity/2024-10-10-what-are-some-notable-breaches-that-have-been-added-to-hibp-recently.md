Recently, several notable breaches have been added to the Have I Been Pwned (HIBP) database, highlighting the ongoing challenges of online security. Here are some significant incidents:



1. **Wayback Machine Breach**


* **Breach Date:** September 28, 2024

* **Date Added to HIBP:** October 9, 2024

* **Compromised Accounts:** Approximately 31,081,179

* **Compromised Data:** Email addresses, screen names, bcrypt-hashed passwords, and other internal data.




The Internet Archive's Wayback Machine suffered a significant breach that exposed data from over 31 million users. The breach was confirmed after hackers defaced the site and left a taunting message regarding the incident. Troy Hunt, the creator of HIBP, received the compromised data and incorporated it into the database shortly after verifying its authenticity[3][4][5].



2. **Blooms Today Breach**


* **Breach Date:** November 11, 2023

* **Date Added to HIBP:** September 3, 2024

* **Compromised Accounts:** 3,184,010

* **Compromised Data:** Email addresses, names, phone numbers, physical addresses, and partial credit card data.




In April 2024, it was reported that records from Blooms Today were being sold on a hacking forum. The breach included sensitive information but did not expose enough credit card data to facilitate fraudulent purchases[1].
