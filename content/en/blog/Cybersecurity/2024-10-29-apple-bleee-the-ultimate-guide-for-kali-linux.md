The Apple-bleee tool is a unique, experimental set of scripts designed specifically for intercepting and analyzing Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) traffic from Apple devices. Hosted on Kali Linux, it is used primarily by security researchers and ethical hackers for analyzing BLE communications, such as device status messages and even requests for sensitive information. In this guide, we’ll explore what apple-bleee is, how to set it up, and how to use it effectively within the Kali Linux environment.



1. What is apple-bleee?



<a href="https://github.com/hexway/apple_bleee">apple-bleee</a> is an open-source, proof-of-concept (PoC) tool designed to intercept and analyze Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) signals from Apple devices. Developed by the security research team Hexway, it allows users to monitor BLE activity, collect metadata, and even attempt to retrieve sensitive data through certain request types, such as those for password sharing. The tool was created strictly for research and education and is popular with cybersecurity professionals looking to understand Apple’s BLE interactions more closely.



2. How apple-bleee Works



apple-bleee works by analyzing BLE advertisements from Apple devices. These are short transmissions used by BLE devices to announce themselves or transmit small amounts of data to nearby devices. apple-bleee leverages these advertisements to gather information on:


* **Device status updates** for nearby Apple devices

* **Password-sharing requests** made via BLE

* **Basic data interception** through hash identification and network configurations
By capturing and decoding these BLE messages, apple-bleee can reveal device presence, signal requests, and other BLE-based communications. Some scripts even attempt to capture identifying data, like portions of hashed phone numbers.



3. Why use Apple-bleee on Kali Linux?



Kali Linux is a widely-used operating system for penetration testing and security research, making it ideal for running apple-bleee. The system includes built-in support for necessary libraries and tools, such as Python and Bluetooth utilities, which enhance apple-bleee’s ability to sniff, decode, and interpret BLE traffic.



Additionally, Kali’s robust hardware support enables advanced BLE monitoring, essential for users working with networked Apple devices in security and research contexts.



4. Prerequisites for Installing Apple-BLEEE



To run Apple-BLEEE effectively, you’ll need:


* **A Bluetooth adapter** capable of BLE communication, ideally supporting both sending and receiving of BLE messages.

* **A Wi-Fi card** that supports active monitor mode with frame injection (often necessary for certain scripts that work with AirDrop, a protocol using Apple’s AWDL technology).

* **Kali Linux Environment**: Preloaded with essential utilities like Python 3 and other libraries required for Apple-BLEEE’s scripts.
For hardware, the Atheros AR9280 Wi-Fi chip is commonly recommended for its monitor mode support, which is crucial for capturing AirDrop data packets.



5. How to Install Apple-BLEEE on Kali Linux



To set up Apple-BLEEE on Kali Linux, follow these steps:


* **Clone the Repository**:



```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hexway/apple_bleee.git
   cd apple_bleee```


<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"start":2} -->
<ol start="2" class="wp-block-list">* **Install Dependencies**: Install required libraries and Bluetooth utilities:



```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install -y bluez libpcap-dev libev-dev libnl-3-dev libnl-genl-3-dev cmake
   sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt```


<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"start":3} -->
<ol start="3" class="wp-block-list">* **Configure Bluetooth Interface**: Set up and verify your Bluetooth adapter is recognized with:



```bash
   hcitool dev
```


<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"start":4} -->
<ol start="4" class="wp-block-list">* **Install Additional Libraries for AWDL** (AirDrop):



```bash
   git clone https://github.com/seemoo-lab/owl.git
   cd owl
   git submodule update --init
   mkdir build &amp;&amp; cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   sudo make install
```



With the dependencies installed, Apple-BLEEE is ready for use.



6. Key Scripts and Their Uses in Apple-BLEEE



Apple-BLEEE contains multiple scripts, each with a unique function:


* **`ble_read_state.py`**: Sniffs BLE traffic from nearby Apple devices and attempts to capture status messages and password-sharing requests.

* **`airdrop_leak.py`**: Intercepts AirDrop transmissions, potentially revealing the sender’s phone number or IP address.

* **`adv_wifi.py`**: Simulates Wi-Fi password-sharing requests, triggering pop-ups on nearby devices under specific conditions.
7. Running the Tool for BLE Traffic Analysis



To begin using Apple-BLEEE, start by running  `ble_read_state.py`, which captures real-time BLE data. Run the script in a terminal as follows:


```bash
sudo python3 ble_read_state.py
```



Without additional parameters, this command collects data from BLE-enabled Apple devices within range. For specific options, such as viewing or decoding hashed phone numbers, append the `-c` flag or other options for more advanced output.



8. Advanced Uses and Parameters of Apple-BLEEE



Apple-BLEEE offers several advanced command-line options:


* **Phone Number Hash Lookup**: Retrieve information using prepared hash tables with `-c`.

* **AirDrop Monitoring**: To track AirDrop attempts and view sender details, use the `airdrop_leak.py` script with monitoring mode enabled.

* **SSID and Region Info**: Some options enable extraction of network SSIDs or regional details about device locations.
Example command:


```bash
sudo python3 airdrop_leak.py -n
```



This script tries to capture the sending device’s IP and MAC addresses along with any hash information.



9. Limitations and Ethical Considerations



Apple-BLEEE was developed solely for educational use and should be used responsibly. Intercepting BLE signals, especially those from mobile devices, can infringe on privacy laws in certain regions. Therefore, only use Apple-BLEEE on devices you own or have explicit permission to analyze. Unauthorized use of BLE sniffing tools can be legally questionable, especially where sensitive data like phone numbers are involved.



10. FAQs about Apple-BLEEE on Kali Linux



**Q1: Can Apple-BLEEE capture private messages from Apple devices?** No, Apple-BLEEE focuses on metadata and BLE advertisements rather than content-based data. It does not capture the contents of private communications.



**Q2: Does Apple-BLEEE work with devices other than Apple products?** Apple-BLEEE is tailored to Apple’s BLE and AWDL standards, so its functionality is limited to non-Apple devices.



**Q3: Is Apple-BLEEE supported on all Bluetooth adapters?** Not all adapters are compatible, especially those without BLE support. A Bluetooth 4.0+ adapter is recommended.



**Q4: Can I use Apple-BLEEE on other Linux distributions?** Yes, while designed for Kali Linux, Apple-BLEEE should function on other Debian-based distributions, though compatibility may vary.



**Q5: Is this tool safe for use in production environments?** Apple-BLEEE is a proof-of-concept tool, so it’s best suited for controlled research environments rather than production.



Apple-BLEEE is a powerful tool for understanding BLE traffic and Apple’s unique wireless protocols. Used responsibly, it can offer valuable insights into device communications and security protocols.
