C++ supports several different data types. Here are some of the most common ones:


*  **Integer types (`int`)**: These are used to store whole numbers. The size of an `int` is usually 4 bytes (32 bits), and it can store numbers from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.

* **Floating-point types (`float`, `double`)**: These are used to store real numbers (numbers with fractional parts). A `float` typically occupies 4 bytes of memory, while a `double` occupies 8 bytes.

* **Character types (`char`)**: These are used to store individual characters. A `char` occupies 1 byte of memory and can store any character in the ASCII table.

* **Boolean type (`bool`)**: This type is used to store either `true` or `false`.

* **String type (`std::string`)**: This is used to store sequences of characters, or strings. It's not a built-in type, but is included in the C++ Standard Library.

* **Array types**: These are used to store multiple values of the same type in a single variable.

* **Pointer types**: These are used to store memory addresses.

* **User-defined types (classes, structs, unions, enums)**: These allow users to define their own data types.




Each of these types has its own characteristics and uses, and understanding them is fundamental to programming in C++.
