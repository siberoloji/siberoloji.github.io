Kotlin is a modern programming language that is easy to learn, especially if you already know Java[1]. Kotlin is used to develop Android apps and server-side apps[1][2].

Here is a plan to learn Kotlin from the beginning:
## [Kotlin Basics](https://www.w3schools.com/KOTLIN/index.php)
 *   [Start with Kotlin Docs](https://discuss.kotlinlang.org/t/ability-to-learn-kotlin-for-1st-lang/25183)
 *   [Learn the basics of Kotlin](https://developer.android.com/courses/pathways/android-development-with-kotlin-1), including data types, operators, variables, control structures, and nullable versus non-nullable variables.
 *   Take a Kotlin quiz to gauge your knowledge.
2. **Kotlin environment setup**
 *   Install the required IDE and other software that are essential for [Kotlin](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/kotlin/index.htm).
 *   For larger projects, writing and managing Kotlin code on your local machine is [important](https://www.programiz.com/kotlin-programming). This allows you to work efficiently with multiple files and dependencies.
 *   Set up and use Kotlin on your computer for larger development projects.
3. **Learn Kotlin with examples**
 *   Learn by example with clarifying examples[1].
 *   Use the "Try it Yourself" editor to learn Kotlin. You can edit the code and view the result in your browser.
4. **Practice Kotlin**
 *   [Develop small software](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/kotlin/index.htm) or projects using Kotlin.
 *   Create [Android](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2020/07/learn-android-and-kotlin-with-no-experience.html) [apps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EExSSotojVI).
5. **Advanced Kotlin topics**
 *   Object-oriented programming[2].
 *   Generics and Lambda functions[2].
 *   Coroutines[2].

Consider these resources for learning Kotlin:
*   **Kotlin Tutorial at W3Schools** This tutorial supplements all explanations with clarifying examples[1].
*   **Full Kotlin Course for Beginners on YouTube** This complete Kotlin course will teach you the most popular programming language on Android so you can start building your own apps[2].
*   **Kotlin Tutorial at Javatpoint** This tutorial provides basic and advanced concepts of Kotlin and is designed for both beginners and professionals[3].
*   **Android Basics in Kotlin** This course is for people without programming experience to learn how to build Android apps[8].
*   **Kotlin Basics – JetBrains Academy** Learn programming by building your own apps[6].
*   **Kotlin Tutorial at Tutorialspoint** This tutorial has been prepared by well-experienced Kotlin programmers to help beginners understand the basics of the Kotlin programming language[7].
