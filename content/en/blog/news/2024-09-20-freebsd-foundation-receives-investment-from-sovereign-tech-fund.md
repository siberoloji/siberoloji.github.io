Germany’s Sovereign Tech Fund (STF) has committed €686,400 to the FreeBSD project for infrastructure modernization. The investment will enhance security, streamline continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) processes, and improve developer tools. Key projects include Zero Trust Builds, reducing technical debt, and modernizing security controls to ensure regulatory compliance. The funding aligns with global efforts to improve open-source software security, benefiting both public and private sectors. The initiative will run from 2024 through 2025, positioning FreeBSD as a leader in secure, open-source digital infrastructure.
